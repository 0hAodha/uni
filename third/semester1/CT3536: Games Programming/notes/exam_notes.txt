- same format as every other year 
- final page is the same as the past few years
    - useful methods and stuff
- don't expect precise arguments and names of methods
- answer 3 of 5

- question 1: 
    - in four parts
    - asking about monobehaviours
    - coroutines
    - partial game, do things write code 
    - one of the partial games was done as a demo over the course 

- question 2: 
     - write short technical notes approx 150 words on each of the four parts
     - in past papers
     - lots of overlaps with past papers
     - can give some code, if appropriate

- question 3:
    - 3 parts 
         - first two about colliders and stuff like that (related things)
         - third part about low level moving objects around 
     - both a lot in past papers

- question 4:
     - write a complete monobehaviour over a number of steps to do a simple behaviour that's useful in unity 
     - has public variables for setting up a prefab
     - involves using vectors and time

- question 5:
    - raycasting 
    - write code for fictional game involving raycasting


- very similar style to the past papers
