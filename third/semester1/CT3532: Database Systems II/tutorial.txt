Types of conflicts:
    - rw
    - wr
    - ww

Conflicts in timestamping are directed: the second of the transactions is said to conflict with the first, not vice-versa.
When a cycle is formed in the transaction graph, the transaction is killed.


BCNF: all determinants (left-hand sides of FDs) are candidate keys
    AB -> C
     C -> B 
     C+ = {C, B} != R


Minimal cover set:
    1. RHS should be singletons
        i.e. X -> YZ becomes X->Y X->Z
    2. minimal LHS
        i.e XYZ -> W and YZ -> W then XYZ->W is redundant and should just be replaced with YZ->W
    3. No redundant FDs
