Types of conflicts:
    - rw
    - wr
    - ww

Conflicts in timestamping are directed: the second of the transactions is said to conflict with the first, not vice-versa.
When a cycle is formed in the transaction graph, the transaction is killed.


BCNF: all determinants (left-hand sides of FDs) are candidate keys
    AB -> C
     C -> B 
     C+ = {C, B} != R
