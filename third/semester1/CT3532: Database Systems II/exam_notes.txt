- 4 questions, do 3
- same type of questions as previous years
- overlap in terms of style with exercise sheets
- most questions have 3 parts with different marks

1. question 1: design (first topic covered)
    a) functional dependencies minimal cover sets (problem based)
    b) normalisation to BCNF (discursive/descriptive)
    c) denormalisation (discursive/descriptive)
    
    - key things to know in general:
        - functional dependency
        - axioms to generate new functional dependencies 
        - minimal cover sets
        - normal forms
            - redundancy / denormalisation

2. question 2: transactions
    a) discuss one of problems (only 3 (think lost update problem etc not sure)) (supposedly easy)
    b) concurrency control protocol to apply to above problem, such as timestamping, two phase locking etc.
    c) distributed databases, how do we manage recovery or two phase locking or something

    - problems that arise: concurrency control, lost update, etc
    - serialisability, guarantee serialisability
    - recovery, system log
    - distributive databases

4. question 4: database models
    a) parallelism
    b) deductive / logic databases (not covered on past papers) (not too hard because we didn't spend long on it)
        - store facts and relations 
    c) security (one of the models touched on 2023-11-14) (not covered on past papers)
        - Bell-LaPadula model or some other model touched on

- old course was called ct332
    - will get deductive / logic databases on old papers
- no more exam material after ./slides/DatabaseSecurity.pdf
