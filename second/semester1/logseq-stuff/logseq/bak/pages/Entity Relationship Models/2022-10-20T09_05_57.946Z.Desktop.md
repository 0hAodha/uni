	- **Data models** are concepts to describe the structure of a database.
	- They comprise:
		- High level or logical models;
		- Representational / Implementational data models;
		- Physical data models.
	- Data models allow for database abstraction.

	- **Entity Relationship Models** are a top-down approach to database design that provide a way to *model the data* that will be stored in a system. The models are then used to *create tables* in the relational model.
	- ER Models are used to identify:
		- [1] The important data to be stored in a database called **entities**.
		- [2] The **relationships** between the entities.
		- [3] The **attributes** of entities.
		- [4] The **constraints&& of relationships & entities.
-
- # ER Model Notation
	- A number of different notations can be used to represent the same model.
		- Chen Notation.
		- IE Crow's Foot Notation.
		- UML.
		- Integrated Definition 1. Extended (IDEF1X).
		-
	- The original (Chen) notation uses diamonds, rectangles, and elipses.
		- This is easier to hand-draw, so it is useful in an exam situation.
		- It is less implementation-oriented than other notations.

			- A **relationship type** is a set of meaningful relationships among entity types.
			- **Chen's Notation:** A diamond shape is used to name the relationship. 1 and M/N are used for the "1" and "many" sides respectively.
			- **Crow's Foot Notation:** The titular "crow's foot" is used as the representation of "many", and one line is used for the representation of "1".
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1664890907305_0.png)

		  card-last-score:: 1
			- The **cardinality ratio** specifies ^^the number of relationship instances that an entity can participate in.^^
			- The possible cardinality ratios for binary relationship types are:
				- $1:1$, "one to one" - at most one instance of entity $A$ is associated with one instance of entity $B$.
				- $1:N$, "one to many" - for one instance of entity $A$, there are 0 or more instances of entity $B$.
				- $M:N$, "many to many" - for one instance of entity $A$, there are 0 or more instances of entity $B$, and for one instance of entity $B$, there are 0 or more instances of entity $A$.
				-
		- ### Structural Constraints on Relationships
			- Often, we may know the min & max of the cardinalities.
				- Example: limit on the number of books that can be borrowed from a library.

		- **Total Participation** (Mandatory Participation): All instances of an entity must participate in the relationship, i.e., *every* entity instance in one set *must* be related to an entity instance in the second via the relationship.
			- For example, the entity "Student" must have **total participation** in the relationship "enrolled" with the entity "Course" - each student *must* be enrolled in a course.

		- **Partial Participation** (Optional Participation): Some subset of instances of an entity will participate in the relationship, but not all, i.e., *some* entity instances in one set are related to an entity instance in the second via the relationship.
			- For example, the entity "Course" would have a **partial participation** in the relationship "enrolled" with the entity "Student" - a course might not have any students enrolled in it.

		- Use the idea of **Ordinality / Optionality**.
			- **Optionality of 0:** If an entity $A$ has partial participation in a relationship to entity $B$, then $A$ is associated with 0 or more instances of entity $B$, so the **optionality sign** goes beside $B$.
				- The optionality sign for an **Optionality of 0** is a **bar**: $|$
			- **Optionality of 1:** If an entity $A$ has full participation in a relationship to entity $B$, then $A$ is associated with at least 1 or more of $B$, so the **optionality sign** goes beside $B$.
				- The optionality sign for an **Optionality of 1** is a **circle** or "o": $\bigcirc$
			- [And vice-versa.]
		- In Crow's Foot notation, there is no diamond, so there is always a direct relationship line between the entities.
			- The **optionality sign** is drawn on this line.
			- The optionality drawn beside some entity $A$ refers to how an instance of entity $B$ is related to entity $A$.
				- That is, whether $B$ can be involved partially (0) or not (1).

			- In Crow's Foot Notation, we can represent the **weak entity** as a normal entity, but do not choose any attributes as the primary key.
			- For an attribute that partially determines the entity instances, we choose the "required" option.
			- We usually represent the relationship between entities using a **solid line**.
				- This indicates that it is an "identifying" relationship.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1664969566989_0.png)

		-
	- In general, with entities, there may be two valid solutions, one with a weak entity, and one without.
		- There is not a huge difficulty if you do not identify weak entities in a solution so long as all the entities have **primary attributes**.
			- It may be slightly non-optimal in terms of introducing an additional primary key that is not needed, but this is not a huge problem for us at this level.

- # Entities or Multi-Valued Attributes?
  collapsed:: true
	- Sometimes, it may not be clear whether something should be modelled as a multi-valued attribute or an entity.
		- Both may be equally correct, as long as you represent all the information that you are asked to.
		- You may see (very little) difference between the two approaches if you map either approach to tables in a database.
-
- # Steps to Create an ER Model
	- 1. Identify entities.
	  2. Identify relationships between entities.
	  3. Draw entities & relationships.
	  4. Add attributes to entities (& relationships, if appropriate).
	  5. Add cardinalities to relationships.
	  6. Add participation constraints (total or partial) to relationships.
	  7. Check that all entities have primary keys identified.

- # Mapping ER Models to Tables in the Relational Model
	- Once you have you ER diagram, you now need to convert it into a set of tables so that you can implement it in a relational mode.
		- Example: As MySQL tables using `CREATE TABLES` commands.
	- This stage is called **Mapping ER Models to Tables in the Relational Model**, and it specifies a set of rules that must be followed in a certain order.
	- The rules specified here are based on **Chen's Notation**.
	- ## Steps
		- [1] For each entity, create a table $R$ that includes all the **simple** attributes of the entity.
		- [2] For strong entities, choose a key attribute as the primary key of the table.
		- [3] For weak entities $R$, include the primary key attributes of the table that corresponds to the owner as foreign key attributes of $R$.
			- The primary key of $R$ is a combination of the primary key of the owner and the partial key of the weak entity type.
			- The relationship of the weak & strong entity is generally taken care of by this step.
		- [4] For each **binary** $1:1$ relationship, identify entites $S$ & $T$ that participate in the relation.
			- If applicable, choose the entity that has **total participation** in the relation.
				- Include the primary key of the other relation as the foreign key in this table.
				- Include any attributes of the relationship as attributes of the chosen table.
			- If both entities have total participation in the relationship, you can choose either one for the foreign key and proceed as above, or you can map two entities & their associated attributes & relationship attributes into one table.
		- [5] For each **binary** $1:N$ relationship, identify the table $S$ that represents the $N$ side and the table $T$ that represents the $1$ side.
			- Include the primary key of table $T$ as a foreign key in $S$ such that each entity on the $N$ side is related to at most one entity instance on the $1$ side.
				- Include any attributes of the relationship as attributes of $S$.
			- For recursive $1:N$ relationships, choose the primary key of the table and include it as a foreign key in the same table with a different name.
		- [6] For each $M:N$ relationship, create a new table $S$ to represent the relationship.
			- Include the primary keys of the tables that represent the participating entity types as foreign keys in $S$ - their combination will form the primary key of $S$.
				- Also include in $S$ any attributes of the relationship.
			- For a recursive $M:N$ relationship, both foreign keys come from the same table (give different names to each) and become the new primary key.
		- [7] For each **multi-valued attribute** $A$ of an entity $S$, create a new table $R$.
			- $R$ will include:
				- An attribute corresponding to $A$.
				- The primary key of $S$, which will be a foreign key in $R$. Call this $K$.
				- The primary key of $R$ is a combination of $A$ & $K$.
				-
-
