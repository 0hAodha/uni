- A **variable** is a symbol used to store a value.
- What is a **strongly typed** language? #card

	- In a **strongly typed** language, you have to tell the compiler / interpreter what **type** the variable is.
	- The compiler / interpreter knows how much space to allocate a variable of a certain type in memory.

- # Java Primitive Variables
	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1663834185000_0.png)
	- ## Default Values
		- Each primitive variable has a **default value**.
		- The default value is used ^^only when the variable is used as a **field** (instance variable).^^
		- If the field is not explicitly assigned a value, the default value is used.
		- For example, the default value for an `int` variable is `0`.
		-
		- The "Code Pad" in BlueJ automatically initialises variables as if they were instance variables.
			- This will not happen in a true Java program, but it is useful for learning the default values.

		- A **reference type** is a data type that's based on a class rather than on one of the primitive types that are built into the Java language.
		- There are 4 categories of reference type:
			- Object Types
			- Interface Types
			- Enum Types
			- Array Types
	- ## Null Default Value
		- The default value of all reference variables is `null`.
		- `null` is a special value in Java meaning "no object".
		- When you first declare a reference variable, its value is `null`.
		-
		- ### `NullPointerException`
			- One of the most common errors generated when running a Java program is `NullPointerException`.
			- This error is thrown when your program encounters a reference variable that has not been initialised.
				- This means that the variable points to its default value = `null`.
			- Your program then tries to get the object that the variable is pointing to do something, but the object doesn't exist, causing Java to generate a `NullPointerException`.
			-
		- ### Memory Leak
			- ```java
			  Bicycle bike1;	// bike1 points to null
			  Bicycle bike2;	// bike2 points to null
			  
			  // bike1 & bile2 are assigned to point to the Bicycle objects just initialised
			  bike1 = new Bicycle();
			  bike2 = new Bicycle();
			  
			  // bike1 & bike2 now both point to null again.
			  bike1 = null;
			  bike2 = null;
			  ```
			- What happens to the bicycle objects that were created but can no longer be referenced?
				- This is what's called a **memory leak**.
				- In this case, you have 2 objects occupying from memory, and you have not deallocated them from memory.
				- In fact, there is no way to deallocate them.
				-
			- #### Garbage Collector
				- The **Garbage Collector** is part of the JRE's memory management process.
				- It runs in the background keeping track of the live objects in a program, and marking the rest as garbage.
				- The data in these marked areas are subsequently deleted, freeing up memory.

	- ## Object Reference Type
		- What is an **Object Reference Type**? #card

			- An **Object Reference Type** is a variable that ^^points to an object.^^
				- It is a **pointer**.
			- A primitive variable contains the value of that primitive type.
			- A variable can never contain an object, but it can contain a pointer to that object.
			- A reference variable contains the value of the memory location of an object.
			- For example:
				- ```java
				  Wheel wheel = new Wheel();
				  ```
				- The `wheel` variable contains the value of the memory location of the new Wheel object.
			- A reference variable does **not** contain the value of the object.

- # Test-Driven Development
	- **TTD** is an *incremental approach* to solving a problem.
	- Incrementally create Stub classes & Stub methods so that your code compiles & runs at all times.
	- To start with, it may run - but it might not do anything interesting.
	- Gradually, we add functionality - making sure that it compiles & runs.
	- We keep doing this until we achieve our minimum criteria for success.
