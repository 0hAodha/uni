			- **Composition** is a type of "has-a" relationship. One object is **composed** of another and relies upon its services for its own functionality.
			- It is one of the fundamental relationships between classes in OOP.
			- For example:
				- The class `RacingBike` **has-a** `Wheel` - **Composition**.
		- How do you represent **Composition** in OOP class diagrams? #card

			- In OOP class diagrams, a **diamond shape** indicates **composition** or a "has-a" relationship.
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1663271062397_0.png)
				- This class diagram tells us that a `Vehicle` object is composed of a single `Engine` object.
		- How do you realise **Composition** in Java? #card

		  card-repeats:: 2
		  card-ease-factor:: 2.46

			- To realise a "has-a" relationship in Java, you must ^^create a link between the **participant classes** using a **reference type variable**.^^
				- The reference declaration is in the **owner** class.

		- What is **Inheritance**? #card

			- **Inheritance** is a type of "is-a" relationship.
			- It is one of the fundamental relationships between classes in OOP.
			- For example:
				- A `RacingBike` **is-a** type of `Bicycle` - **Inheritance**.
