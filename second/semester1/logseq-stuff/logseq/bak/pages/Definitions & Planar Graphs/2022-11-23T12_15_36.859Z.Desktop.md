			- $(a,b,c,e,d)$ is a **walk**.

	  card-last-score:: 1
		- If a bipartite graph is such that *every* vertex in $V_1$ is connected to *every* vertex in $V_2$ (and vice versa), the graph is a **complete bipartite graph**.

	  card-last-interval:: 0.98
	  card-repeats:: 1

	  card-last-score:: 3
		- When a planar graph is drawn without edges crossing, the edges & vertices of the graph divide the plane into regions called **faces**.
		- The number of faces does not change no matter how you draw the graph, as long as no edges cross.
		-
	- ## Example
		- The graph $K_{2,3}$ is **planar**.
		  background-color:: red
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1666951300835_0.png)
			- [[draws/2022-10-28-11-04-05.excalidraw]]
			- The planar representation $K_{2,3}$ has **3 faces** (the "outside" region counts as a face).
		- Give a planar representation of $K_4$, and count how many faces it has.
		  background-color:: red
			- [[draws/2022-10-28-11-22-12.excalidraw]]
		- Why "face"?

	- For any ^^(connected) planar graph^^ with $v$ vertices, $e$ edges, and $f$ faces, we have:
		- $$v - e + f  = 2$$
	- ## Outline of Proof
		- Start with $P_2$.
			- Here, $v=2$, $e = 1$, $f=1$. So $v-e+f=2$.
			- Any other graph can be made by adding vertices & edges (or just edges) to $P_2$.
		- Suppose  $v-e+f=2$ for a graph.
			- If we add a new edge *with* a new vertex, then no new face is created, so $v-e+f$ does not change.
			- If we add a new edge *without* a new vertex, then $f$ will increase by 1, so again, $v-e+f$ does not change.
	- ## Example
		- Is it possible for a connected planar graph to have 5 vertices, 7 edges, and 3 faces? Explain.
		  background-color:: red
			- No. Euler's formula tells us that $v-e+f=2$.
				- Here, $v=5$, $e=7$, $f=3$, so $v-e+f=1$.
			- Any such graph is **not planar**.
