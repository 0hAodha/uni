		- The function `round()` in R goes not necessarily do what you would expect when rounding numbers ending in **.5** - ^^it rounds to the nearest **even** number.^^
			- If you always round up numbers ending in .5, then you are causing an upwards bias.
			- The rounding to even numbers will tend to average out at a zero bias, as 50% go up and 50% go down.
		- ```R
		  # use "round()" to round
		  round(1.5)
		  round(0.5)
		  round(0.7)
		  ```
			- Output:
				- ```R
				  [1] 2
				  [1] 0
				  [1] 1
				  ```
- ## $\pi$ in R #card
  card-last-interval:: 4
  card-repeats:: 2
  card-ease-factor:: 2.7
  card-next-schedule:: 2022-09-22T15:09:00.108Z
  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-09-18T15:09:00.108Z
  card-last-score:: 5
	- ```R
	  # to get pi in R, simply use the in-built constant "pi"
	  pi
	  ```
	- Output:
		- ```R

		  ```
- ## Trigonometric Functions in R
	- ### Sine in R #card
	  card-last-interval:: 4
	  card-repeats:: 2
	  card-ease-factor:: 2.7
	  card-next-schedule:: 2022-09-22T15:15:38.917Z
	  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-09-18T15:15:38.918Z
	  card-last-score:: 5
		- ```R
		  # to get the sine of a number in R, use the function "sin()"
		  sin(0.5 * pi)
		  sin(pi)
		  ```
		- Output:
			- ```R
			  [1] 1
			  [1] 1.224647e-16
			  ```
			- ^^**Note:**^^ $1.224606e-16 \approx 0$. Due to the way computers store numbers, decimals are often slightly off, so $sine(\pi) \ne 0$ even though it should, of course, be equal to zero. Be careful of this!
	- ### Cosine in R #card

	  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-09-18T15:18:39.668Z
	  card-last-score:: 5
		- ```R
		  # use "cos()" to get cosine
		  cos(0)
		  ```
			- Output:
				- ```R
				  [1] 1
				  ```
	- ### Tangent in R #card
