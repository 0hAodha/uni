		- **Specification**
			- Talk to the customer
			- Understand the problems
			- Talk to any relevant stakeholders
		- **Development**
			- Map out the tasks
			- Design the software
			- Develop the solution
		- **Validation**
			- Does the software meet the requirements?
			- Is it what the customer wanted?
		- **Evolution** (maintenance)
			- Modified to adapt
			- Changes in requirements
			- Customer & Market conditions
	- The foundation of software engineering is the **process**.
	- The **goal** of software engineering is to efficiently & predictably deliver a product that meets the requirements.

- # Software Engineering Practice
	- ### **1) Understand the problem** (*Communication & Analysis*)
		- Who are the stakeholders?
		- What are the unknowns?
	- ### **2) Plan the solution** (*Modelling & Software Design*)
		- Have we seen this problem before?
		- Has a similar problem already been solved?
		- Can sub-problems be found?
	- ### **3) Carry out the plan** (*Write the Code*)
		- Does the solution conform to the plan?
		- Has the code been reviewed for correctness?
	- ### **4) Examine the result** (*Test It*)
		- Is each component testable?
		- Does the solution produce results as defined originally?

- # General Software Engineering Questions
	- **What** is the problem to be solved?
		- Requirements definition
	- **What** are the characteristics of the software (system) used to solve the problem?
		- Analysis
	- **How** will the system be realised / constructed?
		- Design
	- **How** will the system be supported long-term?
		- Maintenance

- # Overview of Software Engineering
	- There are 3 generic phrases, regardless of paradigm:
		- **Definition** - a focus on the *What*
			- System Analysis, Software Project Planning, Requirements Analysis
		- **Development** - a focus on the *How*
			- Software Design, Coding, Software Testing
		- **Maintenance** - a focus on *Change*
			- Correction, Adaption, Enhancement

- # Software Engineering Should...
	- Provide a clear statement of the project **mandate** & objectives
	- Create effective means of **communication**
	- Increase user **involvement** & **ownership**
	- Provide an effective **management framework** to support **productivity** & pragmatism
	- Establish **quality assurance** procedures
	- Provide sound resource **estimation** & **allocation** procedures
	- Ensure the **effectiveness** and **durability** of systems produced
	- Encourage the **re-usability** of code and / or solutions
	- Reduce the organisation's **vulnerability** to the loss of software development personnel
	- Reduce & support post implementation **maintenance** of system
