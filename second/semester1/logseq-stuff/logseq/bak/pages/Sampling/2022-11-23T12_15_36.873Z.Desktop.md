- What is a **Parameter**? #card

	- A **parameter** is a single value summarising some feature or variable of interest in the population.
	- It is usually unknown.
- What is **inference**? #card
  card-last-interval:: 33.64
  card-repeats:: 4
  card-ease-factor:: 2.9

	- **Inference** is the process of making decisions about a population based on information in a sample.
- A consequence of **natural variation** is that two samples drawn form the same population will usually give different estimates of the population parameters.

	- What is **non-probabilistic sampling**? #card
	  card-last-interval:: 29.04
	  card-repeats:: 4
	  card-ease-factor:: 2.56

		- **Non-probabilistic sampling** methods are techniques of obtaining a sample that is not chosen at random and may be subject to **sampling bias**.
	- ## Simple Random Sample
		- ### Difficulties:
			- Obtaining a sampling frame (list of all experimental units).
			- Possibly time consuming / expensive.
			- Minority groups, by chance, may not be represented in the sample.
	- ## Stratified Random Sampling #card
	  card-last-interval:: -1
	  card-repeats:: 1
	  card-ease-factor:: 2.36
	  card-next-schedule:: 2022-11-18T00:00:00.000Z
	  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-11-17T20:19:40.391Z
	  card-last-score:: 1
		- 1. Split entire population into **homogeneous groups**, called **strata**.
		  2. Take a Simple Random Sample from each stratum.
		- ### Stratified VS Simple Random Sample
			- Ensure representation from minority groups.
			- Estimates of the population parameters per strata may be of interest.
			- Possible reduction in cost per observation in the survey.
			- Increased accuracy as reduced sampling error (less variation within a stratum).
			-
			- ### Difficulties
				- Can you correctly allocate each individual to one & only one stratum?
				- Should every group receive equal weight?
				- What if some strata are more varied than others?
				- Take into account mean, variance, and cost to get "optimal allocation".
	- ## Cluster Sampling #card
	  card-last-interval:: -1
	  card-repeats:: 1
	  card-ease-factor:: 2.36
	  card-next-schedule:: 2022-11-18T00:00:00.000Z
	  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-11-17T20:18:48.138Z
	  card-last-score:: 1
		- Instead of randomly choosing individuals, a Simple Random Sample of collection or groups of individuals is taken.
		- The population is broken up into regions or groups, usually a *natural partition*, called a **cluster**.
			- Internally heterogeneous, homogeneous between the clusters.
		- Clusters are assumed representation of the entire population.
		- Small number of clusters are selected at random.
		- Every individual within a cluster is observed.
		-
		- ### Cluster Over Stratified
			- Sampling frame not necessarily needed.
			- May be more practical and / or economical than Simple or Stratified Random Sampling.
			- Will be biased if the entire cluster is not sampled.
			- Careful if homogeneity within a cluster and heterogeneity between clusters as this can increase sample error.
			- **Note:** In stratified sampling, all strata are sampled, while in cluster sampling only some clusters are sampled.
- # Studies & Experiments
	- ## Observational Studies & Experiments #card

	  card-repeats:: 1

		- In an **Observational Study**, data is collected only be *observing* what occurs.
			- E.g., surveys, historical records.
		- When researchers want to investigate **causal relationships**, it's best to conduct an experiment.
			- Usually there will be both an explanatory variable & a response variable.
			- Be wary of confounding variables.
	- ## Designed (Comparative) Study
		- An experiment allows us to prove a cause-and-effect relationship.
		- The experimenter must identify:
			- at least one **explanatory variable**, called a **factor** to manipulate.
			- at least one **response** variable to measure.
		- The experimenter must also control any other **nuisance factors** that could influence the response.
			- e.g., weather, day of the week.
