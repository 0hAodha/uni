		- **System Software** is a program dedicated to ^^managing the computer.^^
		- It provides a platform to other software & a general programming environment.
		- There are two main types of system software:
			- **Operating System**
			- **Utility Software**
	- What is the **Operating System (OS)**? #card
	  card-last-interval:: 0.81

		- The **Operating System** provides functions used by the **application software**.
		- It provides the mechanisms for application software to **share** the hardware in an orderly fashion to:
			- **Increase the overall performance** by allowing different application software to use different parts of the computer at the same time.
			- **Decrease the time to execute** a collection of programs and, again, increase the overall performance
		- The OS interacts directly with the hardware to provide an interface to other system software and with application software whenever the application software wants to use the system's resources.
		- The OS is **application-domain independent**, provides **resource abstraction**, and provides **resources sharing** through strict resource management policies.
	- What is **Utility Software**? #card

	  card-last-score:: 3
		- Resource Abstraction is done by providing an ^^abstract model of the operation of the hardware components.^^
		- Abstraction generalises the hardware behaviour but ^^restricts its flexibility.^^
			- With abstraction, certain operations become easy to perform, while others may become ^^impossible^^, such as specific hardware control.
		- An abstraction can be made to be much simpler than the actual resource interface.
			- Simpler resources can be abstracted to a ^^common abstract resource interface.^^

		  card-last-score:: 5
			- **Multiprogramming** is a technique that allows the system to present the illusion that multiple programs are running on the computer simultaneously.
			- It is achieved by ^^switching rapidly between programs.^^
				- Each program is allowed to execute for a fixed amount of time called a **timeslice**.
			- When a program timeslice ends, the OS stops it, removes it, and gives another program control over the processor - this is a **context switch**.
				- To do a context switch, the OS copies the contents of the current program register file into memory, restores the contents of the next program's register file into the processor, and starts executing the next program.
				- From the program POV, they can't tell that a context switch has been performed.
			- **Protection** between multi-programmed programs is very important.
				- Many multiprogrammed computers are **multi-user** - they allow multiple persons to be logged on at a time.
			- Besides Protection, data **privacy** is also important.

			- The result of any program running on a multiprogrammed computer ^^must be the same^^ as if the program was the only program running on the computer.
			- Programs ^^must not be able to access other program's data^^ and must be confident that their data will not be modified by other programs.
			- Programs ^^must not interfere with other program's use of I/O devices.^^
			- **Protection** is achieved by having the ^^OS have full control over the resources of the system^^ (processor, memory, & I/O devices).
			-
			- **Virtual Memory** is one of the techniques used to achieve protection between programs.
				- Each program operates as if it were the only program on the computer, occupying a full set of the address space as in its virtual space.
					- The OS is **translating** memory addresses that the program references into physical addresses used by the memory system.
				- As long two program's addresses are not translated to the same address space, programs can be written as if they were the only ones running on the machine.

				- **Processor Modes** are operating modes for the CPU that ^^place restrictions^^ on the operations that can be performed by the currently running process.
			- Hardware supported CPU modes help the OS to ^^enforce rules^^ that would prevent viruses, spyware, & similar malware from running.
				- Only very specific & limited "kernel" code would run unrestricted.
				- Any other software (including portions of the OS), would run restricted and would have to ask the "kernel" for permission to modify anything that could compromise the system.
			- Multiple mode levels could be designed.
			-
			- The **mode bit** is used to define the **execution capability** of a program on a processor.
				- The mode bit may be logically extended to define areas of memory to be used when the processor is in supervisor mode, versus when it is in user mode.

				- The processor can execute only a ^^subset of the instruction set.^^
				- The executing process has access only to the ^^user space.^^
			- Some processors do not differentiate between protected mode & user mode.
			-
			- #### Privileged Mode
				- To ensure that the OS is the only one that can control the physical resources, it executes in **Privileged Mode**.
				- The OS is also responsible for **Low-Level UI**
					- When keys are pressed, the OS is responsible to determine which program should receive the input.
					- When a program wants to display some output, the user program executes some system call that displays the data.
				- User programs execute in **User Mode**
					- When User Mode programs want to execute something that requires privileged rights, it sends a request to the OS, known as a **system call**, that asks the OS to do the operation for them.

				- A key pressed by the user generates a hardware interrupt.
					- A specialised module of the OS reads the keyed character and stores it in a special command line buffer.
						- There are special characters (e.g., to edit the command line) that are not stored in the command line buffer.
					- Control is taken by the shell (command interpreter) when an **end of line** is detected.
						- The command is **analysed** (with error or success).
						- If successful, the shell decides if it is an **internal** or **external** command (for another module).
							- If **internal:** the shell tries the execution, which can end successfully or with an error.
							- If **external:** the shell looks for the corresponding executable file & executes it with the detected parameters from the previous phrase.
		- 2. From user processes requesting services from the OS
			- #### System Call
				- The parameters of the call are passed according to the **specific OS convention** & hardware architecture.
				- Switch to **protected (supervisor) mode** using a specific mechanism.
					- E.g., software interrupt, trap, special instruction of type "call supervisor".
					- This mechanism is different to a normal call.
				- A **special module** takes over, that will analyse the parameters & their access rights.
					- This module can reject the system call.
				- If accepted, the **corresponding routine** from the OS is executed and the **result** is returned to the user.
					- Upon return, the user mode is returned.
			- #### Message
				- The user process ^^constructs a **message** (A) that describes a desired service.^^
				- It uses the **send** function to pass the message to a trusted operating system process.
					- The send function checks the message, switches the processor to **protected mode**, & then delivers the message to the process that implements the target function.
				- Meanwhile, the user waits for a result with a **message receive** operation.
				- When the kernel finishes processing the request, it sends a message (B) back to the user process.
		-
