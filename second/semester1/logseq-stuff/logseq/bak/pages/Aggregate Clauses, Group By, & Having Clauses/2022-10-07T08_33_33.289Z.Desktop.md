	- **Aggregate Functions** are only supported in `SELECT` clauses & `HAVING` clauses.
	- Keywords `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX` work as expected and can only be applied to **numeric** data.
	- Keyword `COUNT` can be used to count the number of tuples / values / rows specified in a query.
	- We can also use mathematical operations as part of an aggregate function on **numeric** data, e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.

	- `GROUP BY <group attributes>`
	- The `GROUP BY` clause allows the grouping of rows of a table together so that all occurrences within a specified group are collected together.
	- Aggregate clauses can then be applied to groups.

		- The `GROUP BY` clause specifies the group and the aggregate function is applied to the group.
		- `COUNT(*)` can be used to *count* the number of rows (tuples) in the specified groups.
		- `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX` can be used to find the sum, average, min, & max of a *numerical value* in a specified group.
	- ^^**Important:** You must `GROUP BY` **all** attributes in the `SELECT` clause *unless* they are involved in an aggregation.^^
		- This **^^wouldn't work^^** as we do not `GROUP BY` all the attributes in the `SELECT` clause - `salary` remains ungrouped.
			- ```SQL
			  SELECT dno, salary
			  FROM employee
			  GROUP BY dno -- THIS IS WRONG
			  ```

	- `HAVING <group condition>`
		- The `HAVING` clause is used in conjunction with `GROUP BY` and allows the specification of **conditions on groups**.
		- The column names in the `HAVING` clause must also appear in the `GROUP BY` list or be contained within an aggregate function, i.e., you cannot apply a `HAVING` condition to something that has not been calculated already.
