	- **Cloud Computing** is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a ^^shared pool of configurable computing resources^^ (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, & services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

	- Amazon, MS Azure, & Google Cloud are examples of **public clouds**.
	- Any member of the public can sign up and start provisioning computing resources within minutes.
	- They are **highly scalable** and allow an organisation to grow its infrastructure rapidly.

	- A **hybrid cloud** is simply a mix of public & private cloud resources.
	- An organisation may choose this option if there is a mixture in the criticality of their data or computational requirements.
	- Data that doesn't require heightened security can be pushed onto the **public cloud**, while data which does can be hosted on the **private cloud**.
