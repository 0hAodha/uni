		- The **software lifecycle** is an abstract representation of a software process. It defines the steps, methods, tools, activities, and deliverables of a software development project.
		- The following **lifecycle phases** are considered:
			- 1. Requirement Analysis
			  2. System Design
			  3. Implementation
			  4. Integration & Deployment
			  5. Operation & Maintenance
	- ## SDLC Limitations
		- Classical project planning methods have a lot of disadvantages:
			- Huge efforts during the planning phase (requirements + design).
			- Poor requirements conversion in a rapidly changing environment.
			- Treatment of staff as a factor of production.

		- There is no single definition of Agile, but the Agile Manifesto is the closest to a defintion.
			- Set of principles.
			- Developed by Agile Alliance.
		- Agile methods focus on:
			- Individuals & interactions over processes & tools.
			- Working software over comprehensive documentation.
			- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
			- Responding to change over following a plan.
	- The [Agile Alliance](www.agilealliance.org) is a non-profit organisation promotes agile development.
	- ## Agile Motivation
		- Agile proponents argue:
			- Software development processes relying on lifecycle models are too heavyweight or cumbersome.
			- Too many things are done that are not directly related to the software product being produced, i.e., design, models, requirements docs, documentation that isn't shipped as part of the product.
			- Difficulty with incomplete or changing requirements.
			- Short development cycles (Mobile Apps).
			- More active customer involvement needed.
	- There are several Agile methods, including **Scrum** and **Extreme Programming (XP)**.
	- ## SCRUM

			- **Scrum** is an agile project management methodology for managing product development.
			- It allows us to rapidly and repeatedly inspect actual working software (every two weeks to one month).
			- The business sets the priorities. The teams **self-manage** to determine the best way to deliver the highest priority features.
			- Every two weeks to a month, anyone can see real, working software and decide to release it as is or continue to enhance it for another iteration.

			- Self-organising teams.
				- No need for project manager (in theory).
			- Product progresses in a series of month-long or biweekly **sprints**.
			- Assumes that the software cannot be well defined and requirements will change frequently.
			- Requirements are captured as items in a list of **product backlog**.
			- No specific engineering practices prescribed.
				- XP, TDD, FDD.
			- Best approach is to start with Scrum and then invent your own version using XP, TDD< FDD, etc.
		- ### Daily SCRUM / Standup #card

			- Parameters:
				- Daily.
				- 15-minutes.
				- Stand-up.
				- **Not** for problem solving.
				- Only team members, Scrum Master, & Product Owners should talk.
				- Should help to avoid additional unnecessary meetings.
				- Commitment in front of peers to complete tasks.
			- ^^Answer 3 questions:^^
				- ^^What did you do yesterday?^^
				- ^^What will you do today?^^
				- ^^Is anything in your way?^^
			- The Daily SCRUM is **not** a problem-solving session and is **not** a way to collect information about who is behind the schedule.
			- It is a meeting in which members make commitments to each other and to the SCRUM Master.
			- It is a good way for a SCRUM Master to track the progress of the team.
