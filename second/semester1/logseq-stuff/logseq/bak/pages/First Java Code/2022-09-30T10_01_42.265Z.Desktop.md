- What is the **structure of a class**? #card
  card-last-interval:: -1
  card-repeats:: 1
  card-ease-factor:: 2.5
  card-next-schedule:: 2022-09-19T23:00:00.000Z
  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-09-19T18:29:57.359Z
  card-last-score:: 1
	- Every class has the following structure:
		- ```java
		  public class ClassName 
		  {
		    Fields
		    Constructors
		    Methods
		  }
		  ```
- ## Fields
	- What are **Fields**? #card
	  card-last-interval:: 4
	  card-repeats:: 2
	  card-ease-factor:: 2.36
	  card-next-schedule:: 2022-09-22T14:55:21.827Z
	  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-09-18T14:55:21.828Z
	  card-last-score:: 3
		- **Fields**, also known as **instance variables**, store values for an object.
		- Fields define the state of an object.
		- In BlueJ, use *Inspect* to view the state.
		- Some values change frequently, others rarely, or not at all.
- ## Encapsulation
	- What is **Encapsulation**? #card
	  card-last-interval:: 4
	  card-repeats:: 2
	  card-ease-factor:: 2.22
	  card-next-schedule:: 2022-09-23T18:22:08.303Z
	  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-09-19T18:22:08.303Z
	  card-last-score:: 3
		- In **encapsulation**, the ^^variables of a class will be hidden from other classes^^ and can only be accessed through the methods of their current class.
		- This is also known as **data hiding**.
	- Why use encapsulation? #card
	  card-last-interval:: 4
	  card-repeats:: 2
	  card-ease-factor:: 2.22
	  card-next-schedule:: 2022-09-23T18:23:15.213Z
	  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-09-19T18:23:15.213Z
	  card-last-score:: 3
		- In OOP, ^^each object is responsible for its own data.^^
			- This allows an object to have greater control over which data is available to be viewed externally, and how external objects can mutate the object's state.
	- ### Encapsulation Type: Private
		- What is the effect of making a field **private**? #card
		  card-last-interval:: 4
		  card-repeats:: 2
		  card-ease-factor:: 2.46
		  card-next-schedule:: 2022-09-23T18:25:31.450Z
		  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-09-19T18:25:31.450Z
		  card-last-score:: 5
			- Making a field **private** encapsulates their values inside their object.
			- No external class or object can access a private field.
-
- ## Constructors
	- What are **constructors**? #card
	  card-last-interval:: 3.02
	  card-repeats:: 2
	  card-ease-factor:: 2.36
	  card-next-schedule:: 2022-09-22T18:30:51.722Z
	  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-09-19T18:30:51.722Z
	  card-last-score:: 3
		- Constructors:
			- Initialise an object.
			- Have the same name as their class.
			- Have a close association with the fields:
				- They contain the initial values stored in the fields.
				- They contain the parameter values often used for these.
	- What is the point of the keyword `this`? #card
	  card-last-score:: 5
	  card-repeats:: 2
	  card-next-schedule:: 2022-09-22T15:21:45.332Z
	  card-last-interval:: 4
	  card-ease-factor:: 2.7
	  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-09-18T15:21:45.332Z
		- If the input parameter variables in your constructor have the **same name** as your fields, you must use the `this` keyword to distinguish between the two.
		- `this` = "belonging to this object".
		- E.g.,
			- ```java
			  public Bicycle(int speed, int gear, int cadence)
			  {
			    this.speed = speed;
			    this.gear = gear;
			    this.cadence = cadence;
			  }
			  ```

- ## Methods
- What are **methods**? #card
  card-last-interval:: 4
  card-repeats:: 2
  card-ease-factor:: 2.22
  card-next-schedule:: 2022-09-23T18:06:15.300Z
  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-09-19T18:06:15.300Z
  card-last-score:: 3
	- **Methods** implement the *behaviour* of an object.
	- They have a consistent structure comprised of a *header* and a *body*.
- ### Accessor Methods
	- What are **accessor** methods? #card
	  card-last-interval:: -1
	  card-repeats:: 1
	  card-ease-factor:: 2.36
	  card-next-schedule:: 2022-09-19T23:00:00.000Z
	  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-09-19T18:22:14.771Z
	  card-last-score:: 1
		- **Accessor** methods provide information about the state of an object.
		- An accessor method always returns a type that is **not** `void`.
		- An accessor method returns a value (*result*) of the type given in the **header**.
		- The method will contain a **return** statement to return the value.
- ### Mutator Methods
	- What are **mutator** methods? #card
	  card-last-interval:: 4
	  card-repeats:: 2
	  card-ease-factor:: 2.46
	  card-next-schedule:: 2022-09-23T18:23:53.666Z
	  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-09-19T18:23:53.666Z
	  card-last-score:: 3
		- **Mutator** methods alter (*mutate*) the state of an object.
		- Achieved through changing the value of one or more fields.
			- They typically contain one or more *assignment* statements.
			- Often receive parameters.
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1663063179688_0.png)
	- ### Mutator Methods: Set
		- Each field may have a dedicated **set** mutator method.
		- These have a simple, distinctive form:
			- **void** return type
			- method name related to the field name
			- a single formal parameter, with the same type as the type of the field
			- a single assignment statement
		- A typical "set" method:
			- ```java
			  public void setGear (int number)
			  {
			    gear = number;
			  }
			  ```
	- ### Protector Mutators
		- A set method does not always have to assign unconditionally to the field.
			- The parameter may be checked for validity and rejected if innappropriate.
		- Mutators thereby protect fields.
		- Mutators also support *encapsulation*.
		- #### Protecting a Field
			- ```java
			  public void setGear (int gearing)
			  {
			    // this conditional statement prevents innapropriate action.
			    // if protects the "gear" field from values that are too large or too small.
			    if (gearing >= 1 && gearing <= 18)
			    {
			      gear = gearing;
			    }
			    else
			    {
			      System.out.println("Exceeds maximum gear ratio. Gear not set");
			    }
			  }
			  ```
- ### Method Structure
	- The **header**:
		- The head tells us:
			- the *visibility* of the method to objects of other class.
			- whether or not the method *returns a result*.
			- the *name* of the method.
			- whether or not the method takes *parameters*.
		- E.g.,
			- ```java
			  public int getSpeed()
			  ```
	- The **body** encloses the method's *statements*.
-
- ## C vs Java
	- Unlike C, an OOP program will **not** have a pool of global variables that each method can access.
	- Instead, ^^each object has its own data^^, and other objects rely on the *accessor* methods of the object to access the data.
-
- ## Conditional Statements
	- Conditional statements in Java have the same format as in C.
	- ```java
	  if (condition) {
	    do something;
	  }
	  else {
	    do somethingElse;
	  }
	  ```
