- # Introduction to Kanji
	- ## Categories
		- Kanji can be classified into 4 main categories:
			- **Pictographic characters:** originated from pictures of objects (e.g., 山, 川, 馬, 雨).
			- **Indicative kanji:** made of points & lines to indicate abstract ideas (e.g., 一, 三, 上, 下).
			- **Compound kanji:** composed by combining *pictographic kanji* & other types of kanji.
			- **Phonetic - ideographic kanji:** formed by combining *phonetic* & *ideographic* elements.
	- ## On-readings & Kun-readings
		- **On-readings** are based upon the Chinese pronunciation of the kanji when they were first introduced to Japan.
		- **Kun-readings** are based on the pronunciation of the Japanese word whose meaning was close to that of the kanji character.
