- Most of our computation in R will be using data in table form, with rows & columns, which are often stored as a `data.frame` object.
	- The rows usually represent different *observations*, (e.g., humans, cars, etc.) and the columns represent different *variables* (features of the observation), (e.g., height, weight, etc.).

- What does `glimpse()` do? #card
  card-last-interval:: 4
  card-repeats:: 2
  card-ease-factor:: 2.7
  card-next-schedule:: 2022-11-22T18:34:17.944Z
  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-11-18T18:34:17.945Z
  card-last-score:: 5
	- The `glimpse()` function gives us an overview of the dataset on each experimental unit.
- What does `dim()` do? #card
  card-last-interval:: 29.99
  card-repeats:: 4
  card-ease-factor:: 2.56
  card-next-schedule:: 2022-12-14T19:04:53.617Z
  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-11-14T20:04:53.617Z
  card-last-score:: 5
	- The `dim()` function returns the number of rows & columns in a dataframe.
