- # Preface
	- "To maintain a cheerful attitude of mind in the midst of a gloomy and exceedingly responsible task, is no slight artistic feat. And yet, what could be more necessary than cheerfulness? Nothing ever succeeds which exuberant spirits have not helped to produce. Surplus power, alone, is the proof of power."

	- "For many years, a maxim, the origin of which I withhold from learned curiosity, has been my motto:
		- *increscunt animi, virescit volnere virtus.*"
		- *the spirit increases, virtue grows through a wound.*
