		- **Firestore** is a Document Driven Database.
		- Documents follow a `property:value` format - JSON.
		- Scalable, highly performant, and document oriented.
		- The databases tend to scale more easily horizontally.
	- ## Concepts
		- Records in Firestore are known as "Documents".
			- These documents are just JSON data.
		- Documents are grouped into "Collections" which are equivalent to tables in relational databases.
		- Queries are still queries, however there is no SQL.
