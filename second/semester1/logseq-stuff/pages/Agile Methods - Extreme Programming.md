- # XP
	- **eXtreme Programming (XP)** is one of the most popular agile software development methods.
	- Some characteristics of XP include:
		- Pair programming.
		- Refactoring.
		- Test-Driven Development (TDD).
		- Continuous Integration.
		- Metaphor.
		- Small releases.
		- Simple design.
		- Customer tests.

	- All the contributors to an XP project (members of one team) sit together. This team must include a business representative (Product Owner) - the "Customer" - who provides the requirements, sets the priorities, and steers the project.
	- ## Planning
		- XP planning addresses two key questions in software development: predicting what will be accomplished by the due date, and determining what to do next.
		- **Release Planning** is a practice where the Customer presents the desired features to the programmers, and the programmers estimate their difficulty.
		- **Iteration Planning** is the practice whereby the team is given direction every few weeks (Sprints).
	- ## Customer Tests
		- As part of presenting each desired feature, the XP Customer defines one or more automated acceptance tests to show that the feature is working.
		- The team builds these tests and uses them to prove to themselves, and to the customer, that the feature is implemented correctly.
	- ## Small Releases
		- XP teams practice small releases in two important ways:
			- First, the team releases running, tested software, delivering business value chosen by the Customer, every iteration.
			- Second, XP teams release to their end users frequently as well.
	- ## Coding Standards
		- XP teams follow a common coding standard, so that all the code
