The attached instructions are for Windows PCs only, some of the command line options are different for Linux / MAC computers.
If you have a Mac or Linux computer use the following command instead to run a ping with a large payload: ping -s 3500 www.rte.ie
Due to firewall restrictions inside the University network, pings to www.rte.ie may fail.
If this happens run the pings instead to the ip address of your local router.
You can find out the ip address of your local router by doing a trace route to ww.rte.ie - your local router is the first hop shown in the result.
The previous lab work has details on how to run a trace route on different platforms.
On the eduroam wifi network in the lab the ip address of the local router will be something like 140.203.224.3
