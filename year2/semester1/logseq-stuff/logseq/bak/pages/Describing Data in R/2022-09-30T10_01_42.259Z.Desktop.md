- Most of our computation in R will be using data in table form, with rows & columns, which are often stored as a `data.frame` object.
	- The rows usually represent different *observations*, (e.g., humans, cars, etc.) and the columns represent different *variables* (features of the observation), (e.g., height, weight, etc.).

- What does `glimpse()` do? #card
  card-last-interval:: -1
  card-repeats:: 1
  card-ease-factor:: 2.5
  card-next-schedule:: 2022-09-19T23:00:00.000Z
  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-09-19T17:43:30.690Z
  card-last-score:: 1
	- The `glimpse()` function gives us an overview of the dataset on each experimental unit.
- What does `dim()` do? #card
  card-last-interval:: -1
  card-repeats:: 1
  card-ease-factor:: 2.5
  card-next-schedule:: 2022-09-19T23:00:00.000Z
  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-09-19T18:03:27.442Z
  card-last-score:: 1
	- The `dim()` function returns the number of rows & columns in a dataframe.
