- Most of our computation in R will be using data in table form, with rows & columns, which are often stored as a `data.frame` object.
	- The rows usually represent different *observations*, (e.g., humans, cars, etc.) and the columns represent different *variables* (features of the observation), (e.g., height, weight, etc.).

- What does `glimpse()` do? #card
  card-last-interval:: 3.45
  card-repeats:: 2
  card-ease-factor:: 2.6
  card-next-schedule:: 2022-10-10T03:21:42.690Z
  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-10-06T17:21:42.691Z
  card-last-score:: 5
	- The `glimpse()` function gives us an overview of the dataset on each experimental unit.
- What does `dim()` do? #card
  card-last-interval:: 7.48
  card-repeats:: 3
  card-ease-factor:: 2.46
  card-next-schedule:: 2022-10-17T22:44:50.782Z
  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-10-10T11:44:50.783Z
  card-last-score:: 5
	- The `dim()` function returns the number of rows & columns in a dataframe.
