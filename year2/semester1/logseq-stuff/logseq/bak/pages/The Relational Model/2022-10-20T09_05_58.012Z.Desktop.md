- Why learn about relational DBMS?
	- 90% of industry /  enterprise / business applications are still relational DBMS or relational DBMS with extensions (e.g., OO Relational).
	- The majority of industry applications require:
		- **Correctness**
		- **Completeness**
		- **Efficiency** (Complex optimisation techniques & complex indexing structures).
	- Relational DBMS provide this.

- What is the **Relational Data Model**? #card

  card-repeats:: 3
  card-ease-factor:: 2.46

	- The **Relational Data Model** consists of collections of **relations** (often called *tables*) where each relation contains **tuples** (*rows*) and **attributes** (*columns*).
	- The relational data model is closely related to the file system model.
	- Relations are named.

	- A table.
- What are **attributes**? #card
  card-last-interval:: 31.36
  card-repeats:: 4
  card-ease-factor:: 2.8
  card-next-schedule:: 2022-11-07T18:22:42.375Z
  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-10-07T10:22:42.376Z
  card-last-score:: 5
	- **Attributes** are columns.
	- Columns / attributes are ^^almost always fixed^^ and do not change.
- What are **tuples**? #card
  card-last-interval:: 10.24
  card-repeats:: 3
  card-ease-factor:: 2.56
  card-next-schedule:: 2022-10-13T19:30:41.906Z
  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-10-03T14:30:41.907Z
  card-last-score:: 5
	- **Tuples** are rows.
	- Rows contain the data.
	- There is a variable number of rows.
- What is the **cardinality** of a relation? #card
  card-last-interval:: 11.2
  card-repeats:: 3
  card-ease-factor:: 2.8
  card-next-schedule:: 2022-10-14T15:39:55.046Z
  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-10-03T11:39:55.046Z
  card-last-score:: 5
	- The ^^number of tuples in a relation^^ is referred to as the **cardinality** of that relation.
-
- ## Attributes / Columns
	- Each attribute belongs to **one** *domain* and has a single:
		- Name
		- Data Type
		- Format
	- ### Naming Columns #card

		- Case is **not** significant in SQL.
		- No spaces allowed.
		- No reserved keywords (e.g., date) allowed.
		- Choose meaningful variable names.
		- If given the names of relations and attributes, use ^^exactly^^ what you are given.
	- ### Data Types
		- You must ^^specify the **data type**^^ of all attributes (columns) defined.
		- Common data types used include:
			- **varchar(N)**, where **N** is an integer - used for strings.
			- date
			- int
			- double
		- You often must specify the size - especially for integers and strings

		- ### NULL
			- What are **null-valued attributes**? #card
			  card-last-interval:: 10.24
			  card-repeats:: 3
			  card-ease-factor:: 2.56
			  card-next-schedule:: 2022-10-13T19:29:38.227Z
			  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-10-03T14:29:38.227Z
			  card-last-score:: 5
				- **Null-valued attributes** are what occurs when the values of some attribute within a particular tuple may be unknown or may not apply to that particular tuple. A **null value** is used for these cases.
				- **NULL** is a special marker used in SQL to denote the ^^absence of a value.^^
			- In some cases, we wish to allow the possibility of a `NULL` value although they will often require extra handling (e.g., checking `if == NULL`).
			- In other cases, we want to prevent `NULL` from being entered as a value and specify `NOT NULL` as a **constraint** on data entry.
	- ### Atomic Attributes
		- What is an **atomic attribute**? #card
		  card-last-interval:: 11.2
		  card-repeats:: 3
		  card-ease-factor:: 2.8
		  card-next-schedule:: 2022-10-14T15:39:57.801Z
		  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-10-03T11:39:57.802Z
		  card-last-score:: 5
			- An **atomic attribute** is an attribute which contains a ^^single value of the appropriate type^^, generally meaning, "no repeating values of the same type".
			- The relational model should **only** have atomic values.
	- ### Composite Attributes
		- What is a **composite attribute**? #card
		  card-last-interval:: 11.2
		  card-repeats:: 3
		  card-ease-factor:: 2.8
		  card-next-schedule:: 2022-10-14T15:43:20.000Z
		  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-10-03T11:43:20.001Z
		  card-last-score:: 5
			- A **composite attribute** is an attribute that is composed of several atomic attributes.
				- E.g., `Name = FirstName, Middle Initial, Surname`.
			- We often want to decompose a composite attribute into atomic attributes unless there is a very good reason not to.
	- ### Multi-Valued Attributes
		- What is a **multi-valued attribute**? #card
		  card-last-interval:: 10.92
		  card-repeats:: 3
		  card-ease-factor:: 2.46
		  card-next-schedule:: 2022-10-11T06:46:07.658Z
		  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-09-30T08:46:07.658Z
		  card-last-score:: 5
			- A **multi-valued attribute** is an attribute which has lower and upper bounds on the number of values for an individual entry.
				- The ^^opposite of an atomic attribute.^^
			- The relational model should **not** store multi-valued attributes.
				- Database design / redesign should be used to deal with this issue by creating more attributes (columns) or more tables.
		- ### Derived Attributes
			- What are **derived attributes**? #card
			  card-last-interval:: 11.2
			  card-repeats:: 3
			  card-ease-factor:: 2.8
			  card-next-schedule:: 2022-10-14T18:27:17.519Z
			  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-10-03T14:27:17.520Z
			  card-last-score:: 5
				- A **derived attribute** is an attribute whose value can be determined from another attribute.
					- E.g., you can derive age from birthdate.
				- It is a good idea to not directly store attribute which can be derived from other attributes.
			-
- ## Collection of Relations
	- A Relational Data Model consists of a collection of relations (tables).
		- Tables are **cross-linked**.
-
	- A relational database usually contains many relations (tables) rather than storing all data in one single relation.
	- What is a **Relational Schema**? #card
	  card-last-interval:: 8.35
	  card-repeats:: 3
	  card-ease-factor:: 2.46
	  card-next-schedule:: 2022-10-17T16:51:22.982Z
	  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-10-09T08:51:22.982Z
	  card-last-score:: 5
		- A **relational schema**, $R$, is the ^^definition of a **table** in the database.^^ It can be denoted by listing the table name and the attributes:
			- $$R=\{A_1,A_2,...,A_n\}$$
				- where $A_i$ is an attribute.
			- E.g., with $n=3$, `works_on(essn, pno, hours)`.
- ## Linking Tables
	- Two ^^extremely important concepts^^ within the relational model which allows tables to be linked & cross-referenced are:
		- **Primary Key** attributes.
		- **Foreign Key** attributes.
	-
	- ### Primary Keys
		- Fundamental concept of **Primary Keys**: #card
		  card-last-interval:: 10.24
		  card-repeats:: 3
		  card-ease-factor:: 2.56
		  card-next-schedule:: 2022-10-10T17:12:29.217Z
		  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-09-30T12:12:29.218Z
		  card-last-score:: 5
			- ^^All tuples (rows) in a relation must be **distinct**.^^
			- To ensure this, we must have one or more attributes / columns whose data values will ^^always be unique for each tuple^^ - these attributes are called **key attributes** and are used to identify a tuple in the relation.
			- There may be a few possibilities for the **primary key** - these are called **Candidate Keys**.
				- One candidate key is ultimately chosen as the primary key during the Design Stage.
		- What is a **Primary Key**? #card
		  card-last-interval:: 9.28
		  card-repeats:: 3
		  card-ease-factor:: 2.32
		  card-next-schedule:: 2022-10-12T20:30:50.694Z
		  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-10-03T14:30:50.694Z
		  card-last-score:: 5
			- A **primary key** is defined as one or more attributes per table where:
				- there can only be one such primary key per table
				- the primary key can never contain the `NULL` value
				- all values entered for the primary key must be unique (no duplicates across the rows)
			- Often, primary keys are used as indices.
			- We use the convention (in writing) that attribute which form primary keys are $\text{\underline{underlined}}$.

	- ### Foreign Keys
		- What is a **Foreign Key**? #card
		  card-last-interval:: 10.24
		  card-repeats:: 3
		  card-ease-factor:: 2.56
		  card-next-schedule:: 2022-10-14T17:16:57.806Z
		  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-10-04T12:16:57.806Z
		  card-last-score:: 5
			- A **Foreign Key** is an attribute, or a set of attributes, within one table that matches or **links to** a **candidate key** of some other table (possibly the same table).
			- More formally:
				- Given relations $r_1$ and $r_2$, a **foreign key** of $r_2$ is an attribute (or set of attributes) in $r_2$ where that attribute is a **candidate key** in $r_1$. Relations $r_1$ and $r_2$ may be the same relations.
		- #### Foreign Key Terminology
			- The **parent**, **master**, or **referenced** table is the relation containing the candidate key(s).
			- The **child** or **referencing** table / relation is the relation containing the foreign key.
