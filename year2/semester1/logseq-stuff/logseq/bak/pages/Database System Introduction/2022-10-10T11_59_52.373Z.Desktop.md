	- A **single repository** of data (which may be distributed) is maintained that is **defined once** and then accessed by various users via a **DBMS**.

		- The **DataBase Management System (DBMS)** is a collection of programs that facilitates the process of ^^defining, constructing, & manipulating^^ databases for various applications.

		- 1. **Define** database (DDL)
		  2. **Manipulate** database (SQL)
		  3. **Control** redundancy
		  4. **Restrict** unauthorised access
		  5. **Enforce** integrity constraints
		  6. Provide multiple user interfaces / **views**
		  7. Provide **concurrent access**
		  8. Provide mechanism for **recovery**
		  9. Provide **back-up**
		  10. Allows representation of complex relationships between data (For efficiency & optimisation reasons)

		- Strict schema & multiple tables / relations
		- Complexity
		- Size
		- Cost of DBMS
		- Additional hardware costs
		- Cost of conversion
		- Performance
		- Higher impact of failure

		- **Administrators (DBA)** - accounts, passwords, privileges. Requiring constant vigilance
		- **System Analysts** - "What's required to solve a problem? What does the business need?"
		- **Designers** - ER diagrams, mapping ER diagrams to tables
		- **Application Programmers** - creating tables, adding data, creating queries
		- **End users**

- What is **Database Abstraction**? #card
  card-last-interval:: 9.28
  card-repeats:: 3
  card-ease-factor:: 2.32
  card-next-schedule:: 2022-10-10T19:18:04.573Z

	- **Database Abstraction** refers to the hiding of the details of data storage that are not needed by most database users.
	- The aim is to separate user's views of the database from the way that it is "physically" represented.
	- 3 ways in which data can be described:
		- **External:** user's view
		- **Conceptual:** logical structure as seen by DBA
		- **Internal:** DBMS and OS view of data
- What is the database **schema**? #card
  card-last-interval:: 9.28
  card-repeats:: 3
  card-ease-factor:: 2.32
  card-next-schedule:: 2022-10-09T18:10:33.547Z
  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-09-30T12:10:33.548Z
  card-last-score:: 3
	- The database **schema** is the ^^logical structure of the database.^^
- What is the database **instance**? #card
  card-last-interval:: 11.2
  card-repeats:: 3
  card-ease-factor:: 2.8
  card-next-schedule:: 2022-10-14T18:29:01.333Z
  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-10-03T14:29:01.333Z
  card-last-score:: 5
	- The database **instance** is ^^the actual content of the database at some point in time.^^
