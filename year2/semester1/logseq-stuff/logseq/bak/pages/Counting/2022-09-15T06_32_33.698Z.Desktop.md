- ## The Additive & Multiplicative Principles
	- ### The Additive Principle
		- What is the **Additive Principle**? #card
		  card-last-interval:: -1
		  card-repeats:: 1
		  card-ease-factor:: 2.5
		  card-next-schedule:: 2022-09-13T23:00:00.000Z
		  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-09-13T10:46:53.779Z
		  card-last-score:: 1
			- If an event $A$ can occur $m$ ways, and event $B$ can occur $n$ (disjoint) ways, then event "$A$ **or** $B$" can occur $m + n$ ways.
	- ### The Multiplicative Principle
		- What is the **Multiplicative Principle**? #card
		  card-last-interval:: 4
		  card-repeats:: 1
		  card-ease-factor:: 2.6
		  card-next-schedule:: 2022-09-16T11:37:21.246Z
		  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-09-12T11:37:21.246Z
		  card-last-score:: 5
			- If event $A$ can occur $m$ ways, and each possibility allows for event $B$ to occur in $n$ (disjoint) ways, then the event "$A$ **and** $B$" can occur in $m \times n$ ways.

- ## Counting with Sets
	- What is a **set**?
		- A **set** is a collection of things.
		- The items in a set are called *elements*.
		- A set is **unordered**.
