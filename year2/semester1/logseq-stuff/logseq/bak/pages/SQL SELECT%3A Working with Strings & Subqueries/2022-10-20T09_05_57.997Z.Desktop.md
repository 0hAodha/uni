		- Used to **concatenate** strings.
		- Similar usage to other programming languages.
		- ```sql
		  SELECT
		  	CONCAT(fname, ' ', minit, ' ', lname) AS Name
		  FROM
		  	employee
		  WHERE
		  	salary BETWEEN 50000 AND 80000

		- `ORDER BY <attribute list> <order (ASC or DESC)> `.
		- Allows the results of a query to be ordered by values of one or more attributes.
		- Either **ascending** `ASC` or **descending** `DESC` - ascending by default.
		- Must be the *last* clause of a `SELECT` statement.
- # `TOP` & `LIMIT` #card

	- The `SELECT TOP <N>` clause is used to specify the number of tuples (N) to return, but it is not supported by MySQL.
	- Instead, MySQL supports a `LIMIT <N>` clause which has the same functionality.
	- The `LIMIT` clause is listed at the end of the query,
	- Example: List the employees with the top 3 salaries.
		- ```sql
		  SELECT
		  	ssn, CONCAT(fname, ' ', lname) as Name, salary
		  FROM
		  	employee
		  ORDER BY
		  	salary DESC
		  LIMIT 4;
		  ```

		- MySQL usually allows single & double quotes to be used interchangably.
		- Generally, single quotes should be used for strings (`varchar()`, `text`, etc.).

			- You have to be careful with apostrophes in strings, as an opening quote could be accidentally closed by an apostrophe. ^^Could this be avoided with double quotes?^^
			- To overcome this, if there is an apostrophe in a string, it should be replaced by **two** apostrophes side-by-side `''` (this is a general rule for all special characters - have two of the character) or escape it with `\`.
			- Example: Select the salary for the employee with surname O'Grady.
				- ```SQL
				  SELECT salary
				  FROM employee
				  WHERE lname = 'O''Grady';
				  ```
			- We must also take care when inserting string data using `INSERT INTO`.

		- SQL is case insensitive (apart from table names if on a Linux server).
		- Case insensitivity generally applies to string searching.
		- However, *often* when working with strings we do not look for an exact match (i.e., an exact match using `=`).
		- To support partial matching, we often use **pattern-matching characters** and `LIKE` with wildcard characters `%` and `_`.
			- `%` represents 0 or more characters.
			- `_` Represents a single character.
		- ### Regex
			- We can use regex for more complicated string matching.
			- ```sql
			  SELECT <attribute>
			  FROM <relation>
			  WHERE <attribute> REGEXP <regexp>
			  ```
			- `^` Matches position at the **beginning** of the searched string.
			- `$` Matches position at the **end** of the searched string.
			- `[]` Matches any character inside the square brackets.
			- `[^]` Matches any character **not** inside the square brackets.
			- `*` Matches preceeding character 0 or more times.
			- `+` Matches preceeding character 1 or more times.
			- `|` OR.
			- `{n}` Matches preceeding character n number of times.

	- What methods can you use for accessing data across multiple tables? #card
		- There are 3 potential approaches:
			- Joins.
			- Subqueries.
			- Union queries.
	- ## Subqueries #card

		- A **subquery** (also called a **nested** query)is a query with another query.
		- The subquery *usually* returns data that will be used in the main query.
		- Data returned from the subquery may be a **set of values** or a **single value**.
		- Subqueries can be used with the `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements.
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1664275471660_0.png)
		- The `SELECT` statement that contains a subquery is called an **outer query**.
		- ### Connecting Inner & Outer Queries #card

			- If a subquery returns only **one value** then we can use operators such as `=`, `!=`. `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`.
			- If a subquery *could* return **more than one value** (i.e., a list of values), then we need connectors such as `IN`, `ANY`, `ALL` to check through the values of the subquery.
				- The keyword `NOT` can also be used where appropriate.
				- These connectors are generally used with basic algebraic operators: `=`, `!=`. `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`.
				- `ALL` - the condition is true if the comparison is true for **every** (all) values returned by the subquery.
				- `ANY` - the condition is true if the comparison is true for **at least one** (any) value returned by the subquery.
				- `IN` - the condition is true if the comparison is true for **at least one** value returned by the subquery, i.e., a value IN the subquery.
					- `IN` checks for equality - it can be used for a list of values or a single value - it does not require any additional algebraic operator.
			- In addition, we can have a more general condition using:
				- `EXISTS` -  True if there exists at least one value in the result from a subquery.
				- `NOT EXISTS` - True if there is nothing in the result from a subquery (i.e., it is empty).
