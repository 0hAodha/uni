	  card-repeats:: 2
	  card-ease-factor:: 2.7
	  card-next-schedule:: 2022-09-23T18:25:18.076Z
	  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-09-19T18:25:18.076Z
	  card-last-score:: 5
		- A major productivity technique for hardware & software is to use **abstractions** to characterise the design at different levels of representation
		- Lower-level details are hidden to offer a simpler model at higher levels.
	- ### 2. Make the **Common Case** Fast #card
	  card-last-interval:: 4
	  card-repeats:: 2
	  card-ease-factor:: 2.46

	  card-last-score:: 5
		- Making the **common case fast** will tend to enhance performance better than optimising the rare case.
		- The common case is often simpler than the rare case, and hence is usually easier to enhance.

		  card-last-score:: 5
			- The address ^^contains only the address of the lowest byte^^, and a number of bytes to be read is specified, e.g., 4 bytes.
		- #### Memory Alignment & Words of Data
			- When the computer's **word size** is 4 bytes, the data to be read should be at a memory address which is ^^some multiple of four.^^
			- When this is not the case, e.g., the data starts at address 14 instead of 16, then the computer has to read two or more 4 byte chunks and do some calculation before the requested data has been read, or it may generate ^^an alignment fault.^^
			- Even though the previous data structure end is at, for example, address 13, the next data structure should start at address 16. Two **padding bytes** are inserted between the two data structures at addresses 14 & 15 to align the next data structure at address 16.

				- **IO/M** is a **status signal** in **Isolated I/O** that denotes whether the read/write operation pertains to the memory or to the I/O subsystem.
					- When the **signal is low** (IO/M = 0), i.e., IO/M is `true`, it denotes **memory-related operations**.
					- When the **signal is high**, (IO/M = 1), i.e., IO/M is `false`, it denotes an **I/O operation**.

		- Possible definition: a program that runs on the computer that ^^knows about all the hardware^^ and usually ^^runs in privileged mode^^, having ^^access to physical resources that user programs can't control^^, and has the ^^ability to start & stop user programs.^^
		- The OS is responsible for managing the physical resources of complex systems, such as PCs, workstations, mainframe computers, etc.
		- It is also responsible for ^^loading & executing programs^^ and ^^interfacing with the users.^^
	- Usually, there is no operating system for **small embedded systems**.
		- Computers designed for one specific task.

			- **FCFS - First Come, First Served:** processes are moved to the CPU in the order in which they arrive.
			- **SJN - Shortest Job Next:** looks at all processes in the **ready state** and dispatches the one with the smallest service time.
			- **Round Robin:** distributes the processing time equitably among all ready processes.

				- 2. Programs ^^must not be able to access other programs' data^^ and must be confident that their data will not be modified by other programs (for security and privacy).
				- 3. Programs ^^must not interfere with other programs' use of I/O devices.^^

				- Protection is achieved by the ^^operating system having full control over the resources of the system (processor, memory, and I/O devices)^^ through:
					- **Privileged Mode:** the operating system is the only one that can control the physical resources it executes in privileged mode.
						- User programs execute in **user mode**.
					- **Virtual Memory:** each program operates as if it were the only program on the computer, occupying a full set of the address space in its virtual space.
						- The OS is *translating* memory addresses that the program references into physical addresses used by the memory system.
