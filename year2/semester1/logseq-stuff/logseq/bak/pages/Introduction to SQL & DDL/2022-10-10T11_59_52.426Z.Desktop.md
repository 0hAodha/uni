		- **Structured Query Language (SQL)** is a special-purpose **programming language** for relational database systems.
	- ### Features of SQL
		- SQL is based on *relational algebra*.
			- All relational, set, and hybrid operators are supported.
			- SQL also has additional operators to allow easier query development.
		- SQL has been *standardised* since 1987.
		- The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) form SQL standard committees. Many vendors also take part.
		- Recent standards include XML-related features in addition to many others, including JSON data types.
	- ### ANSI/ISO SQL
		- Despite standards, there can be a lack of portability between database systems due to:
			- Complexity & size of standards (not all vendors will implement all of the standard).
			- The vendor may want to keep the syntax consistent with their other software products / OS or develop features to support their user base.
			- The vendor may want to maintain backward compatibility.
			- The vendor may want to maintain "Vendor lock-in".
		- What is the **standardised SQL syntax** comprised of? #card

			- The **standardised SQL syntax** comprises 3 components:
				- **DDL -** Data Definition Language
				- **DCL -** Data Control Language
				- **DML -** Data Manipulation Language
		- ### DCL: Data Control Language
			- What is **DCL** used for? #card
			  card-last-interval:: 3.45
			  card-repeats:: 2
			  card-ease-factor:: 2.6
			  card-next-schedule:: 2022-10-10T03:24:46.993Z

			  card-last-score:: 5
				- **Data Control Language** is used to control access to the database & to database relations.
				- It is the role of the **database administrator**.
				- Very important in multi-user systems.
			- What are the typical **DCL** commands? #card
			  card-last-interval:: 8.88

			  card-last-score:: 3
				- ```sql
				  GRANT
				  REVOKE
				  ```
				- These can be used to:
					- grant / revoke access to the database.
					- grant / revoke access to individual relations.
		-
		- ### DDL: Data Definition Language
			- What is **DDL**? #card
			  card-last-interval:: 8.76
			  card-repeats:: 3
			  card-ease-factor:: 2.46
			  card-next-schedule:: 2022-10-09T06:14:56.915Z

			  card-last-score:: 3
				- **Data Definition Language** is a standardised language to ^^define the schema of a database.^^
				- It's the back-end of "design" options on the Interface (e.g., Create options).
			- What are the typical **DDL** commands? #card
			  card-last-interval:: 4
			  card-repeats:: 2
			  card-ease-factor:: 2.22
			  card-next-schedule:: 2022-10-11T10:33:30.852Z
			  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-10-07T10:33:30.852Z
			  card-last-score:: 3
				- The typical DDL tasks include creating, altering, and removing **database objects** such as tables & indexes.
				- Common DDL keywords include:
					- ```sql
					  CREATE
					  ALTER
					  DROP
					  ADD
					  CONSTRAINT
					  ```
			- #### Create a table, its indexes, & constraints
				- Steps:
					- 1. Specify **table** (relation) name.
					  2. For each attribute in the table, specify **Attribute Name**, **Data Type**, and any **constraints**.
					  3. Specify the  **Primary Key** of the table: choose one or more attributes.
					  4. Specify **Foreign Keys** *if they exist* and assuming that the attributes & table you are referencing exist (you may have to return to this step).
					- Steps 1-3 ^^must be completed for all tables.^^
			- #### Data Types
				- The main data types are **strings**, **numeric**, and **date/time**.
				-
				- **Strings**
					- What can **strings** contain? #card
					  card-last-interval:: 11.2
					  card-repeats:: 3

					  card-last-score:: 5
						- `CHAR(size)` is a string of **fixed length**. `size` can be from 0 to 255 - the default is 1.
						- `VARCHAR(size)` is a string of **variable length**. `size` can be from 0 to 65,535.
							- if `size` is not specified, it is unlimited
						- `TEXT` is the same thing as `VARCHAR` except it is unlimited by default, and takes no argument `size`.
				-
				- **Date/Time**

						- `TIME` Format: hh:mm:ss
						- `DATETIME` Format: YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss
						- `YEAR` A year in four-digit format
				-
				- **Numeric**
					- The maximum `size` value is 255.
					- MySQL supports **unsigned** numeric types but not all DBMS do.
					- Types of numerics: #card
					  card-last-interval:: 9.28

						- `INTEGERS` - *See next block*.
						- `BOOL / BOOLEAN` -  0 is False; non-zero is True.
						- `FLOAT` - A floating-point number. 4 bytes, single precision.
						- `DOUBLE` - A floating-point number. 8 bytes, double precision.
						- `DECIMAL(size, d) / DEC(size,d)` - An exact, fixed-point number.
							- `size` = total number of digits (max 65, default 10)
							- `d` = number of digits after the decimal point (max 30, default 0)
				-
				- **Integers**
					- Types of integers:
						- | **Type** | **Bytes** | **Range** |
						  | `TINYINT` | 1 | -128 to 127 |
						  | `SMALLINT` | 2 | -32,768 to 32,767 |
						  | `MEDIUMINT` | 3 | -8,388,608 to 8,388,607 |

					- ^^Note:^^ the number in brackets next to integers only refers to the number of digits to display, not size.
				-
				- **Others**
					- Unicode char/string
					- Binary
					- Blob, Json, etc.
		- ### DML: Data Manipulation Language
			- What is **DML**? #card
			  card-last-interval:: 9.68
			  card-repeats:: 3
			  card-ease-factor:: 2.42
			  card-next-schedule:: 2022-10-19T00:50:25.340Z
			  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-10-09T08:50:25.341Z
			  card-last-score:: 5
				- **Data Manipulation Language** is a standardised language used for ^^adding, deleting, & modifying data in a database.^^
			- What are the typical **DML** commands? #card

			  card-repeats:: 3
			  card-ease-factor:: 2.08
			  card-next-schedule:: 2022-10-11T18:42:42.165Z

- # Autonumber
	- What does `AUTO_INCREMENT` do in MySQL? #card
	  card-last-interval:: 10.24
	  card-repeats:: 3
	  card-ease-factor:: 2.56
	  card-next-schedule:: 2022-10-17T15:39:18.480Z
	  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-10-07T10:39:18.480Z
	  card-last-score:: 5
		- Specifying an attribute to `AUTO_INCREMENT` tells the DBMS to ^^generate a number automatically when a new tuple is inserted into a table.^^
		- Often, this is used for an "artificial" **primary key** value which is needed to ensure that we have a primary key, but has no meaning for the data being stored.
		- Using `AUTO_INCREMENT` means that the DBMS takes care of inserting a unique value automatically every time a new tuple is inserted.
		- By default, `AUTO_INCREMENT` is **1**, and is incremented by 1 for each new tuple inserted.

- # Constraints
	- ## Types of Constraints
		- ### Foreign Keys
			- What is the syntax for specifying **Foreign Keys**? #card
			  card-last-interval:: 8.76
			  card-repeats:: 3
			  card-ease-factor:: 2.46
			  card-next-schedule:: 2022-10-09T06:15:41.002Z
			  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-09-30T12:15:41.003Z
			  card-last-score:: 5
				- ```sql
				  FOREIGN KEY (attributename) REFERENCES tablename(attributename)
				  ```
				- You need to specify:
					- The keyword `FOREIGN KEY` to indicate that it is a foreign key constraint.
					- The attribute name(s) that will identify the foreign keys in the current table.
						- If there is more than one attribute, they should be separated by commas.
						- Attribute names should be enclosed in brackets.
					- The keyword `REFERENCES` to specify the attribute that the foreign key references.
					- The table name and the attribute name of the attribute being referenced by the foreign key.
						- Again, the attribute name(s)should be in brackets.
						- The table name should be **outside** the brackets.
			- ^^You cannot create a foreign key link unless the attribute that it is referencing exists.^^
			- ### Using `ALTER` to Modify Design
				- **Remember:** You cannot create a foreign key link *unless* the attribute it's referencing already exists.
				- If you want to create everything but the foreign keys initially, you can add a foreign key later using the `ALTER TABLE` command
				-
				- #### Syntax for `ALTER` Command
					- To add a constraint:
						- ```SQL
						  ALTER TABLE tablename
						  ADD CONSTRAINT constraintname FOREIGN KEY (attributename) REFERENCES tablename(attribute name);
						  ```
					- To add an attribute (column) constraint:
						- ```SQL
						  ALTER TABLE tablename
						  ADD attributename DATATYPE;
						  ```
		- ### Domain Constraints
		  id:: 6321ba81-0b92-447e-9c6f-1953528d51a8
			- What is the **Domain Constraint**? #card
			  card-last-interval:: 4.28
			  card-repeats:: 2
			  card-ease-factor:: 2.6
			  card-next-schedule:: 2022-10-11T16:20:44.796Z
			  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-10-07T10:20:44.796Z
			  card-last-score:: 5
				- The value of each attribute A must be an **atomic** value from the **domain** dom(A).
					- Essentially: ^^the data types & formats must match to that specified.^^
		- ### Entity Integrity Constraints (Primary Key Constraints)
		  id:: 6321bafc-6bfc-42da-96a9-f05bcfdff9ba
			- What is the **Primary Key / Entity Integrity Constraint**? #card
			  card-last-interval:: 13.2
			  card-repeats:: 3
			  card-ease-factor:: 2.7
			  card-next-schedule:: 2022-10-13T16:14:37.382Z
			  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-09-30T12:14:37.382Z
			  card-last-score:: 5
				- The **primary key** should uniquely identify each tuple in a relation.
				- This means:
					- No duplicate values allowed for the primary key
					- No `NULL`values allowed for the primary key
			- **Note:** `NULL` values may possibly also not be permitted for other attributes.
				- We often see this constraint when filling out forms online ("*required") and the constraint is often necessary for non-key attributes.
				- However, we should be careful to only add `NOT NULL` constraints in the databases when they are really necessary.
			-
		- ### Referential Integrity Constraints
			- What are **Referential Integrity Constraints**? #card
			  card-last-score:: 5
			  card-repeats:: 4
			  card-next-schedule:: 2022-10-28T18:17:48.915Z
			  card-last-interval:: 24.27
			  card-ease-factor:: 2.56
			  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-10-04T12:17:48.915Z
				- **Referential Integrity Constraints** are specified between two relations and require the concept of a **foreign key**. The constraint ensures that ^^the database must **not** contain any unmatched foreign keys.^^
				- Therefore, a relationship involving foreign keys **must** be between attributes of the ^^same type & size.^^
				- In addition, a value for a foreign key attribute **must** exist already as a candidate key value.
				- Essentially: "no unmatched foreign keys".
				-
		- ### Semantic Integrity Constraints
			- What are **Semantic Integrity Constraints**? #card
			  card-last-interval:: 8.88
			  card-repeats:: 3
			  card-ease-factor:: 2.22
			  card-next-schedule:: 2022-10-09T09:15:32.324Z
			  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-09-30T12:15:32.324Z
			  card-last-score:: 3
				- **Semantic Integrity Constraints** ensure that the data entered into a row reflects an allowable value for that row. The value must be within the *domain*, or allowable set of values, for that column.
			- How are **Semantic Integrity Constraints** specified? #card
			  card-last-interval:: -1
			  card-repeats:: 1
			  card-ease-factor:: 2.5
			  card-next-schedule:: 2022-10-08T23:00:00.000Z
			  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-10-08T15:32:01.681Z
			  card-last-score:: 1
				- **Semantic Integrity Constraints** are specified & enforced using a *constraint specification language*.
			- What are the two types of **Semantic Integrity Constraints**? #card
			  card-last-interval:: 4
			  card-repeats:: 2
			  card-ease-factor:: 2.32
			  card-next-schedule:: 2022-10-12T15:15:01.657Z
			  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-10-08T15:15:01.658Z
			  card-last-score:: 3
				- **State Constraints:** Constrain an entity to being in certain states.
				- **Transition Constraints:** Constrain an entity to only being updated in certain ways.
	- ## Setting Constraints
		- **Domain Constraints** are set automatically once the data type is chosen.
		- **Entity Constraints** are also set automatically once a primary key has been chosen.
		- Usually default constraints are set for foreign keys, but these can be changed.
		-
	- ## Update Operations & Constraint Violations
		- The DBMS must check that the constraints are not violated whenever **update operations** are applied.
		-
		- ### Insert Operation
			- What does the **Insert Operation** do? #card
			  card-last-interval:: 13.2
			  card-repeats:: 3
			  card-ease-factor:: 2.7
			  card-next-schedule:: 2022-10-13T16:15:27.475Z
			  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-09-30T12:15:27.476Z
			  card-last-score:: 5
				- The **Insert Operation** provides a list of attribute values for a new tuple $t$ that is to be inserted into a relation $R$.
					- This can happen directly via the interface or via the query.
				- If a constraint is violated, the DBMS will reject the insertion - usually with an explanation.
		- ### Delete Operation
			- How can a **Delete Operation** violate constraints? #card
			  card-last-interval:: 10.24
			  card-repeats:: 3
			  card-ease-factor:: 2.56
			  card-next-schedule:: 2022-10-17T15:39:11.689Z
			  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-10-07T10:39:11.689Z
			  card-last-score:: 5
				- A **delete operation** can only violate **integrity constraints**, i.e., if the tuple being deleted is referenced by the foreign key from other tuples.
				- The DBMS can:
					- reject deletion, without explanation.
					- attempt to *cascade* deletion.
					- modify referencing attribute.
		- #### Update Operation

			- What is an **Update** Operation? #card
			  card-last-interval:: -1
			  card-repeats:: 1
			  card-ease-factor:: 2.5
			  card-next-schedule:: 2022-10-08T23:00:00.000Z
			  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-10-08T15:18:56.111Z
			  card-last-score:: 1
				- An **update** operation is used to change the values of one or more attributes in a tuple of a table.
				- Issues already discussed with insert & delete could arise with this operation, specifically:
					- If a primary key is modified, that's essentially the same as deleting one tuple and inserting another tuple in its place.
					- If a foreign key is modified, the DBMS must ensure that the new value refers to an existing tuple in the reference relation.
		- ### Cascade Update & Delete
			- Whenever tuples in the **referenced** (master) table are deleted or updated, the respective tuples of the **referencing** (child) table with a matching foreign key column will be deleted or updated as well.
			- Note that if cascading `DELETE` is turned on, there could be many deletions performed with a single query such as:
				- ```sql
				  DELETE FROM employee
				  WHERE ssn = 12345678;
				  ```
