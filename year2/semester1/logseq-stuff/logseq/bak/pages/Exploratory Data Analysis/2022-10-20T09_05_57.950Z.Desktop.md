			- **Discrete:** non-divisible, single points of data, **counts** - e.g., number of texts sent
			- **Continuous:** measurements that, if placed on a number scale, can be placed in an infinite number of spaces between two whole numbers - e.g., age, rent, temperature
-
- Pie charts make data very difficult to interpret & read - **don't use them**.

				- $$\bar{x} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}=\frac{x_i}{n}=\frac{x_1+x_2+...+x_n}{n}$$
				  :LOGBOOK:

		  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-10-10T11:40:32.584Z
		  card-last-score:: 3
			- Given that the observations in a sample are $x_1,\ x_2,\ ...\ ,\ x_n$, arranged in **increasing order** of magnitude, the **sample median** is:
				- $$\bar{x} = \begin{cases}x_{(n+1)/2}, & \text{if $n$ is odd},\\ \frac{1}{2}(x_{n/2} + x_{n/2+1}), &\text{if $n$ is even.} \\ \end{cases}$$

		  collapsed:: true
		  card-last-interval:: 11.2
		  card-repeats:: 3
		  card-ease-factor:: 2.8

			- What is the **interquartile range** of a sample? #card
			  card-last-interval:: 17.31
			  card-repeats:: 4
			  card-ease-factor:: 2.08
			  card-next-schedule:: 2022-10-27T18:43:51.820Z
			  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-10-10T11:43:51.821Z
			  card-last-score:: 3
				- The **interquartile range** is the middle 50% of the data.
					- Therefore, it is ^^robust to outliers.^^
				- To calculate the **IQR**, first split the data in 4 quarters and subtract the value at $Q_3$ from the value at $Q_1$.
					- $$IQR=Q_3-Q_1$$
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1663005545935_0.png)
			- #### Tukey's Method for IQR
				- There are also many other methods for calculating IQR.
				- 1. Put data in **ascending** order.
				  2. The **lower quartile** ($Q_1$)is the **median** of the **lower** 50% of the data, including the median.
				  3. The **upper quartile** ($Q_3$) is the **median** of the **upper** 50% of the data, including the median.
		- #### Standard Deviation #card
		  card-last-interval:: 3.33
		  card-repeats:: 2
		  card-ease-factor:: 2.46

		  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-10-08T15:24:00.798Z
		  card-last-score:: 5
			- A common measure of spread is the **standard deviation**, which takes into account how far *each* data value is from the mean.
				- A **deviation** is the distance of a datapoint from the mean.
			- Since the sum of all the deviations would be zero, we square each deviation and find an average of the deviations called the **variance**.
				- We then get the positive square root of the **sample variance** to get the the **sample standard deviation**, which is preferable to the sample variance, as the sample variance is in squared units.
			- The **standard deviation** is ^^sensitive to outliers.^^
			- How do you calculate the **sample variance**, and hence, the **sample standard deviation**? #card
			  card-last-interval:: 4
			  card-repeats:: 2
			  card-ease-factor:: 2.7
			  card-next-schedule:: 2022-10-11T10:46:54.597Z
			  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-10-07T10:46:54.597Z
			  card-last-score:: 5
				- The **sample variance**, denoted by $s^2$, is given by:
					- $$s^2=\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}$$
					- The **sample standard deviation**, denoted by $s$, is the **positive square root** of $s^2$, that is:
						- $$s=\sqrt{s^2}$$
	- ### Shape
		- #### Graphical Summaries of Data
			- Depends on the variable of interest.
				- **Categorical** response variable -> bar chart or pie chart.
					- **Categorical** response variable ^^with an explanatory variable^^ -> grouped bar chart.
				- **Continuous** response variable -> histogram, boxplot, densit plot.
					- **Continuous** response variable ^^with an explanatory variable^^ -> grouped boxplot.
		-
			- What is a **boxplot**? #card
			  card-last-interval:: 2.8
			  card-repeats:: 2
			  card-ease-factor:: 2.6

			  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-10-08T15:00:03.971Z
			  card-last-score:: 5
				- A **boxplot** is a graphical display showing centre, spread, shape, & outliers.
				- It displays the **5-number summary**:
					- *min, Q1, median, Q3, max*
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1663236210540_0.png)
		- What is a **histogram**? #card
		  card-last-interval:: 10.8
		  card-repeats:: 3
		  card-ease-factor:: 2.7
		  card-next-schedule:: 2022-10-15T07:07:49.634Z
		  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-10-04T12:07:49.636Z
		  card-last-score:: 5
			- **Histograms** are useful to show the general shape, location, and spread of data values.
			- Representation by *area*.
			- **Construction**
				- Determine range of data *minimum, maximum*.
				- Split into convenient intervals or *bins*.
				- Usually use 5 to 15 intervals.
				- Count number of observations in each interval - *frequency*.
		- When talking about the shape of the data, make sure to address the following 3 questions:
			- 1. Does the histogram have a single, central hump or several well-separated bumps?
			  2. Is the histogram or boxplot **symmetric**, or more spread out in one direction (skewed)?
			  3. Any unusual features? e.g.., outliers, spikes.

		- #### Explanatory & Response Variables
		  collapsed:: true
			- To identify the **explanatory** variable in a pair of variables, identify which of the two is suspected of affecting the other and plan an appropriate analysis
				- explanatory variable -might effect-> response variable
					- continent -might effect-> life expectancy.

		- **R Markdown** is a file format for making ^^dynamic documents in R.^^
		- R Markdown is written in Markdown and contains chunks of embedded R code (data management, summaries, graphics, analysis & interpretation) all in one document.
		- Documents can be **knitted** to HTML, PDF, Word, and many other formats.
	- ### Key Benefits of R Markdown
		- Makes it easy to produce statistical reports with code, analysis, outputs, and write-up all in one place.
		- Perfect for reproducible research.
		- Easy to convert to different document types.
	- ### Structure
		- R Markdown contains **three** types of content:
			- A **YAML Header**.
			- Text, formatted with Markdown.
			- Code chunks.
