					- The **Product Backlog** is a list of desired work on the project (the requirements).
					- It's usually a combination of:
						- **story-based work** - "let user search & replace".
						- **task-based work** - "improve exception handling".
					- The list is prioritised by the **Product Owner**.
						- The **Product Owner** is typically a Product Manager, Marketing, Internal Customer, etc.
						- Priority groupings (high, medium, low, etc.).
						- Re-prioritised at the start of each sprint.
						- Spreadsheet (usually).
				- To create a Sprint Backlog, you must have a Sprint goal.
				- The Scrum team takes the Sprint Goal and decides what tasks are necessary.
				- The Team self-organises around how they will meet the Sprint Goal.
					- Manager does not assign tasks to individuals.
				- Managers don't make decisions for the team.
				- A Sprint Backlog is created.
				- #### Sprint Backlogs during the Sprint
					- Changes
						- The Team adds new tasks whenever they need to, in order to meet the Sprint Goal.
						- The Team can remove unnecessary tasks.
						- But, the Sprint Backlog can only be updated by the team.
					- Estimates are updated whenever there's new information.
