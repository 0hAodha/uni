	- A **Processor Programming Model** defines ^^how instructions access their operands and how instructions are described in the processor's assembly language.^^
	- Processors with different programming models can offer similar sets of operations but may require very different approaches to programming.

		- The **Instruction Cycle** is the ^^procedure of processing an instruction^^ by the microprocessor.
			- **Fetch:** read the instructions from memory
			- **Decode:** Determine what is to be done
			- **Execute:** Perform the operation
		- Each of the functions fetch -> decode -> execute consist of a sequence of one or more operations inside the CPU (and interaction with the subsystems).

- ## Stack Architectures
	- ### The Stack
		- **Last In First Out (LIFO)** data structure.
		- Consists of **locations**, each of which can hold a **word of data**.
			- It can be used to explicitly **save / restore** data.
		- What operations does the stack support? #card

		  card-last-score:: 5
			- The stack supports ^^two operations.^^
				- **PUSH:** takes one argument and places the value of the argument at the top of the stack.
				- **POP:** removes one element from the stack, saving it into a predefined register of the processor.
		- The stack is ^^used implicitly by procedure call instructions.^^
			- (if available in the data set).
		- When new data is added to the stack, it is placed at the top of the stack, and all of the contents of the stack are pushed down one location.

			  2. **Memory Implemented Stack** #card
				- Limited by the ^^physical memory of the system.^^
				- Slow compared with hardware stacks, since extra memory addressing has to take place for each stack operation.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1662989698764_0.png){:height 405, :width 638}
				- Every **push operation** will ^^increment the top of the **stack pointer**^^ with the word size of the machine.
				- Every **pop operation** will ^^decrement the top of the stack pointer^^ (with the word size of the machine).
		- **Stack overflows** can occur in both stack implementations
			- What is a **stack overflow**? #card

			  card-last-score:: 5
				- A **stack overflow** occurs when the amount of data in the stack exceeds the amount of space allocated to the stack (or the hardware limit of the stack).

	  card-repeats:: 3
	  card-ease-factor:: 2.08

	  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-10-03T14:30:35.452Z
	  card-last-score:: 3
		- Instructions in a stack-base architecture get their operands from the stack and write their results to the stack.
		- The advantage of this is that ^^program code takes little memory - there is no need to specify the address of the operands or registers.^^
			- PUSH is one exception, because it needs the operand to be specified (either as a constant or as an address).
	- ### Programs in a Stack-Based Architecture
		- Writing programs for stack-based architecture is not easy.
			- Stack-based architectures are better suited for **postfix** notation rather than **infix** notation.
		- What is **infix notation**? #card
		  card-last-interval:: 11.2

		  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-10-03T11:42:45.628Z
		  card-last-score:: 5
			- **Infix notation** is the traditional way of representing mathematical expressions, with ^^operations placed **between** the operands.^^
				- e.g., a + b
		- What is **postfix notation**? #card
		  card-last-interval:: 11.2
		  card-repeats:: 3
		  card-ease-factor:: 2.8
		  card-next-schedule:: 2022-10-14T15:39:50.328Z
		  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-10-03T11:39:50.328Z
		  card-last-score:: 5
			- In **postfix notation**, ^^the operation is placed **after** the operands.^^
				- e.g., a b +
			- Stack-based architectures are better suited for **postfix notation**.
				- Once an expression has been converted into postfix notation, implementing it in programs is easy.
	- ### Using Stacks to Implement Procedure Calls
		- Programs need a way to **pass inputs to the procedures** that they call and to receive outputs back from them.
		- Procedures need to be able to **allocate space in memory for local variables** without overriding any data used by their calling program.
		- It is impossible to determine which registers may be used safely by the procedure (especially if the procedure is located in a library).
			- So, a mechanism to **save / restore registers** of the calling program has to be in place.
		- Procedures need a way to figure out where they were called from.
			- So, the execution can **return to the calling program** where the procedure completes (they need to restore the program counter).
		- How are procedure calls implemented in Stacks? #card

		  card-last-score:: 3
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1662992719528_0.png)
			- When a procedure is called, a **block of memory** in the stack called a **stack frame** is allocated.
			- The top of the stack pointer is incremented by the **number of locations** in the stack frame.
			- When a procedure finishes, it jumps to the **return address** of the stack and the execution of the calling program resumes.
		- How are nested procedure calls implemented in the stack? #card

- ## General-Purpose Register Architectures
	- ### General-Purpose Register File
		- In GPR Architectures, instructions read their operands and write their results to a **random access register file**.
		- The general-purpose register file allows the ^^access of **any** register in **any** order^^ by specifying the number (register ID) of the register.
		- What is the main difference between a GPR & a stack? #card
		  card-last-interval:: 9.28
		  card-repeats:: 3

		  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-10-03T11:43:13.452Z
		  card-last-score:: 3
			- The main difference between a GPR and a stack is that repeatedly reading a register will produce the same result and **will not** modify the state of the register file.
				- Popping an item from a LIFO structure (stack) **will** modify the contents of the stack,
		- Many GPR architectures assign special values to some registers in the register file to make programming easier.
			- e.g., sometimes, register 0 is hardwired with value 0 to generate this most common constant.
	- ### Instructions in GPR Architecture
		- What do GPR instructions need to specify? #card

		  card-last-score:: 5
			- GPR instructions need to specify:
				- **the register** that holds their **input operands**
				- the register that will hole the **result**
		- What is the most common GPR instruction format? #card

		  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-09-19T17:48:52.100Z
		  card-last-score:: 5
			- The most common GPR instruction format is the **three operands instruction format**.
				- e.g., "ADD r1, r2, r3" instructs the processor to read the contents of r2 and r3, add them together, and write the results in r1.
			- Instructions that only have one or two inputs are also present in GPR architecture.
		- Which architecture allows **caching**? #card
		  card-last-interval:: 11.2
		  card-repeats:: 3
		  card-ease-factor:: 2.8
		  card-next-schedule:: 2022-10-11T16:11:50.487Z
		  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-09-30T12:11:50.488Z
		  card-last-score:: 5
			- In GPR Architecture, ^^programs can choose which values should be stored in the register file at any given time^^, allowing them to **cache** the most accessed data.
			- In stack-based architectures, once the data has been used, it's gone.
			- From this point of view, ^^GPR architectures have **better performance**^^, at the expense of needing **more storage space** for the program.
				- larger instructions are needed to encode the addresses of the operands.

	  card-last-score:: 5
		- Programming a GPR architecture processor is **less structured** than programming a stack-based architecture processor.
			- There are **fewer restrictions on the order** in which operations can be executed.
				- In stack-based architectures, instructions must execute in the order that would leave the operands for the next instructions on the top of the stack.
				- In GPR, any order that places the operands for the next instruction in the register file before the instruction executes is valid.
				- Operations that access different registers can be **reordered** without making the program invalid.

		- Instructions take **fewer bits** to encode.
		- **Reduced amount of memory** taken up by programs.
		- Manages the **use of registers automatically** (no need for programmer intervention).
		- The instruction set **does not change** if the size of the register file has changed.
	- ## GPR Architectures
		- With the evolution of technology, the amount of space taken up by a program is less important.
		- Compilers for GPR architecture achieve **better performance** with a given number of general-purpose registers than those on stack-based architectures with the same number of registers.
			- The compiler can choose which values to keep (**cache**) in the register file at any time.
