		- A **Process** is a dynamic entity that executes a program on a particular set of data using resources allocated by the system.
			- Two or more processes could execute the same program, each using its own data & resources.
		- It is a ^^program in execution.^^
		- It is composed of:
			- Program.
			- Data.
			- **Process Control Block (PCB)**: contains the state of the process in execution.

		- In order to execute, a process needs an **Abstract Machine Environment** to manage its use of resources.
		- The **Process Control Block (PCB)** is required to map the environment state onto the physical machine state.
		- The OS keeps a **process descriptor** for each process.

		- Each execution of a program generates a process that is executed.
		- Inter-process relationships:
			- **Competition:** Processes are trying to get access to the same resources of the system, therefore a protection between processes is necessary.
			- **Cooperation:** Sometimes the processes need to communicate between themselves and exchange information - synchronisation is needed.

			- The **Process Manager** implements:
				- **CPU Sharing** (called *scheduling*): Allocate resources to processes in conformance with certain policies.
				- **Process Synchronisation** & **Inter-Process Communication**: Deadlock strategies & protection mechanisms.

	- ## Process - User Perspective
		- When processes are executed in a quasi-parallel fashion, the processes need to synchronise to each other for correct functionality - this is done with directives `wait`/`signal`.
			- `wait`- wait for a signal from a specific process.
			- `signal` - send a signal to a specific process.

		- The processor's principle function is to execute machine instruction residing in main memory.
			- These instructions are provided in the form of *programs*.
			- A processor may interleave the execution of a number of programs over time.
		- ### Program View
			- Its execution involves a sequence of instructions within that progam.
			- The behaviour of individual processes can be characterised by a sequence of instructions called the ***trace*** of the process.
		- ### Processor View
			- The processor executes instructions from main memory, as dictated by changing values in the Program Counter (PC) register.
			- The behaviour of the processor can be characterised by showing how the traces of various processes are **interleaved**.

			- The process can be in one of two states: *running* or not *running*.
			- When the OS creates a new process, it enters into the *not running* state; after that, the process exists - it is known to the OS and waits for the opportunity to run.
			- From time to time, the currently running process will be interrupted and the dispatcher process will select a new process to run.
				- The new process will be moved to the *running* state and the former one to the *not running* state.

				- Each process needs to be represented.
					- Information relating to each process, including current state & location in memory.
					- Waiting processes should be kept in some kind of queue.
						- List of pointers to processes blocks.
						- Linked list of data blocks, each block representing a process.
				- Dispatcher behaviour:
					- An interrupted process is transferred to the *waiting queue*.
						- If the process is completed or aborted, it is discarded.
					- The dispatcher selects a process from the queue to execute.

			- **Running:** The process is currently being executed.
				- For single-processor systems, one single process can be in this state at a time.
			- **Ready:** The process is prepared to execute when given the turn.
			- **Blocked:** The process cannot execute until some event occurs.
				- Such as the completion of an I/O operation.
			- **New:** The process has been created, but has not yet been accepted in the pool of executable processes by the OS.
				- Typically, a new process has not yet been loaded into main memory.
			- **Exit:** The process has been released from the pool of executable processes by the OS.
				- Completed or due to some errors.

					- There are two queues: the **ready queue** & the **blocked queue**.
						- When a process is admitted into the system, it is placed in the **ready** queue.
						- When a process is removed from the processor, it is either placed in the **ready** queue or the **blocked** queue, depending on the circumstances.
						- When an event occurs, all the processes waiting on that event are moved from the **blocked** queue into the **ready** queue.
						- ![image.png](../assets/image_1664199424570_0.png)
					- There are multiple **blocked** queues - one per event.

		- `create(&process_id, attributes)`
			- Creates a new process with implicit or specified attributes.
		- `delete(process_id)`
			- Sometimes known as `destroy`, `terminate`, or `exit`.
			- Ends the process specified by `process_id`.
			- Whenever the process is terminated, all the files are closed, and all the allocated resources are released.
		- `abort(process_id)`
			- The same as `delete` but for *abnormal termination*.
			- Usually generates a "**post-mortem dump**" which contains the state of the process before the abnormal termination.
		- `suspend(process_id)`
			- Puts the specified process into a **suspended** state.
		- `resume(process_id)`
			- Moves the specified process from the *suspended* state to the *ready* state.
		- `delay(process_id, time)`
			- Suspends the specified process for a specified period of time.
			- After the delay time elapses, the process is moved to the ready state.
		- `get_attribtutes(process_id, &buffer_attributes)`
			- Used to find out the attributes for the given process.
		- `set_attributes(process_id, buffer_attributes)`
			- Used to set the attributes of the specified process.

									- This is information that is needed by the operating system to perform its scheduling function. Typical items of information include:
										- **Process State:** Defines the readiness of the process to be scheduled for execution (e.g., running, ready, waiting, halted).
										- **Priority:** One or more fields may be used to describe the scheduling priority of the process. In some systems, several values are required (e.g., default, current, highest-allowable).
										- **Scheduling-Related Information:** This will depend on the scheduling algorithm used. Examples are the amount of time that the process has been waiting an the amount of time that the process executed the last time it was running.
										- **Event:** Identity of the even the process is awaiting before it can be resumed.
										- **Data Structuring:** A process may be linked to another process in a queue or other structure.
										- **Inter-Process Communication:** Various flags, signals, & messages may be associated with communication between two independent processes.
										- **Process Privileges:** Processes are granted privileges in terms of the memory that may be accessed and the types of instruction that may be executed. In addition, privileges may apply to the use of system utilities & services.
										- **Memory Management:** This section may include pointers to segment and/or page tables that describe the virtual memory assigned to this process.
										- **Resource Ownership & Utilisation:** resources controlled by the processes may be indicated, such as opened files. A history of utilisation of the processor or other resources may also be included.
											- This information may be needed by the scheduler.

- ## Threads & Processes
	- A **process** is sometimes defined as a *heavyweight process*.
	- A **thread** is defined as a *lightweight process*.
	- Separate two ideas:
		- **Process:** Ownership of memory, files, other resources.
			- Execution of applications.
		- **Thread:** Unit of execution we use to dispatch.
			- Share the same address space hence we can read from and write to the same data structures.

		- A **thread** is a unit of computation associated with a particular heavyweight process, using many of the associated process's resources.
			- It has a minimum of internal state & a minimum of allocated resources.
		- A group of threads are share the same resources.
			- e.g., files, memory space, etc.
		- The **process** is the execution environment for a family of threads.
			- A process with one thread is a **classic process**.
		- Each thread has an individual execution state.
		- Each thread has a control block, with a state (Running / Blocked / etc.), saved registers, an instruction pointer.
		- There is a separate stack & hardware state (PC, registers, PSW, etc.) per thread.
		- Shares memory & files with other threads that are in that process.
		- Faster to create a thread than a process.
