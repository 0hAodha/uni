	- A **password** is a memorised secret used to confirm the identity of a user.
		- Typically, an arbitrary string of characters including letters, digits, or other symbols.
		- A purely numeric secret is called a **Personal Identification Number (PIN)**.
	- The secret is memorised by a party called the **claimant** while the party verifying the identity of the claimant is called the **verifier**.
	- The claimant & the verifier communicate via an **authentication protocol**.
- # Some Password Alternatives
	- One-Time Password (OTP).
		- Transaction Authentication Number (TAN) list used for online banking - they can only be used once.
	- Time-synchronised one-time passwords.
	- Biometric methods.
		- Fingerprints, irises, voice, face.
	- Cognitive passwords.
		- Use question & answer cue/response pairs to verify identity.

- # Algorithmic Generation of OTP
	- Paper-based TANs are hard to manage -> both the claimant and the verifier need to have a copy of every OTP (possibly hundreds of them).
	- Idea: each OTP may be created from the passt OTPs used.
		- An example of this type of algorithm, credited to Leslie Lamport, uses a **one-way function**  (hash function).
	- ## One-Way Functions
		- What is a **hash function**? #card

			- A **one-way function** $H$ produces a fixed-size output $h$ based on a variable size input $s$.
				- $$H(s) = h$$
			- $H$ is also called a **hash function**, $h$ is called a **hash** (value).
			- Important: *one-way property*:
				- For a given hash code $h$, it is infeasible to find $s$ that $H(s) = h$.

			- For every claimant, a random seed (starting value) $s$ is chosen.
			- A hash function $H(s)$ is applied repeatedly (e.g., 1,000 times) to the seed, giving a value of:
				- $$H(H(H(...(H(s)....))))$$
			- The user's first login uses an OTP $p$ derived by applying $H$ 999 times to the seed, i.e., $H^{999}(s)$.
			- The verifier can authenticate that this is the correct OTP, because $H(p) = H^{1000}(s)$, the value stored.
			- The value stored is then replaced by $p$ and the user is allowed to log in.
			- The next login must be accompanied by $H^{998}(s)$.
			- Again, this can be validated because hashing gives $H^{999}(s)$ which is $p$, the value stored after the previous login.
			- The new value replaces $p$ and the user is authenticated.
			- This process can be repeated another 997 times, each time the password will be $H$ applied one fewer times.

			- Each user has a unique piece of hardware called a **security token** that generates an OTP (e.g., mobile phone).
			- Inside the token is an accurate clock that has been synchronised with the clock of the verifer.
			- Both claimant token and verifier server calculate identical OTPs that are based on time.

- # Some New Biometric Methods
	- **Hand geometry:** Measurement & comparison of the (unique) different physical characteristics of the hand.
	- **Palm vein authentication:** Uses an infrared beam to penetrate the user's hand as it is waved over the system; the veins within the palm are returned as black lines.
	- **Retina scan:** Provides an analysis of the capillary blood vessels located in the back of the eye.
	- **Iris scan:** Provides an analysis of the rings, furrows, & freckles in the coloured ring that surrounds the pupil of the eye.
	- Face recognition, signature, & voice analysis.
	- **Behavioural biometrics:**

- # Multi-Factor Authentication
	- This may include a combination of the following:
		- Some physical object in the possession of the user, e.g., a USB stick with a secret token, a bank card, a key, etc.
		- Some secret known only to the user, such as a password, PIN, TAN, etc.
		- Some physical characteristic of the user (biometrics), such as a fingerprint, eye iris, voice, typing speed, pattern in key press intervals, etc.
		- Somewhere you are, such as connection to a specific computing network or utilising a GPS signal to identify the location.
