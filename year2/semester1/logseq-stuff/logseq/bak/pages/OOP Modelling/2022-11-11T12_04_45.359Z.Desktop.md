- # Modelling the Problem
	- A major part of OOP is modelling the problem.
	- The goal is to identify the **principle objects** in the problem domain, which we model as classes, the **responsibility** of each of these objects, and the **collaborations** between objects.
	- The objective of OOP Modelling is to produce a simplified **class diagram**.
		- **Classes** represent real-world entities.
		- **Associations** represent collaborations between the entities.
		- **Attributes** represent the data held about these entities.
		- **Generalisation** can be used to simplify the structure of the model.

	- Consider the following principles when assigning responsibilities:
		- An **Object** is responsible for its own data.
			- An Object is responsibility for communicating its state.
		- **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each **Class** should have a ^^single responsibility.^^
			- All its services should be aligned with that responsibility.
