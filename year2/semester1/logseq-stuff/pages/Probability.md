- Probability provides the *framework* for the study & application of statistics.
- # What are Probabilities?
	- Take, for example, a 6-sided die about to be tossed for the first time.
	- **Classical:** 6 possible outcomes, by symmetry, each equally likely to occur,
	- **Frequentist:** Empirical evidence shows that similar dice thrown in the past have landed on each side about equally often.
	- **Subjective:** The degree of individual belief in occurrence of an event can be influenced by classical or frequentist arguments.
		- Subjective probabilities are also influenced by other reasons when symmetry arguments don't apply & repeated trials are not possible.
-
- # Probability
	- The probability of an event $A$ is the number of (equally likely & disjoint) outcomes in the event divided by the total number of (equally likely & disjoint) possible outcomes.
		- $$P(A) = \frac{\text{\# of outcomes in A}}{\text{\# of possible outcomes}}$$
		- $$(0 \leq P(A) \leq 1)$$

			- The set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment is called the **sample space**,  $S$.
				- $S$ is **discrete** if it consists of a finite or countably infinite set of outcomes.
				- $S$ is **continuous** if it contains an interval of real numbers.
				- $$P(S) = 1$$

			- An event is denoted by $E$ or by capital letters, $A$, $B$, etc.

			- A **Compound Event** is a collection of **more than one** sample point / possible outcomes.
	- ## Permuatations
		- A **permutation** is an arrangement of objects.
		- It can also be an arrangement of $r$ objects chosen from $n$ distinct objects where replacement in the selection is not allowed.
		- The symbol, $P^n_r$ represents the number of permutations of $r$ objects selected from $n$ objects.
		- The calculation is given by the formula:
			- $$P^n_r = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$$
	- ## Joint Events (and / or)
		- Probabilities of **joint events** can often be determined from the probabilities of the individual events that comprise them.
		- Joint events are generated by applying basic set operations to individual events, specifically:
			- **Complement** of event $A$ is $\bar{A} =$ all outcomes *not* in $A$.
			- **Union** of events $A \cup B$; $A$ **or** $B$ or both.
			- **Intersection** of events $A$ **and** $B$ -> $A \cap B$.
			- **Disjoint** events cannot occur together -> $A \cap B = \empty$.

	- For any two events $A$ and $B$, the probability of union is given by:
		- $$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$$
	- For two **disjoint** (also called **mutually exclusive**) events $A$ and $B$, the probability that one *or* the other occurs is the sum of the probabilities of the two events (provided that $A$ and $B$ are disjoint).
		- $$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$$
		- If $P(A \cup B)$ is greater than 1, then you know you have made a mistake and that the events were not mutually exclusive -> there is an intersection.

		- For two **independent** events $A$ and $B$, the probability that *both* $A$ **and** $B$ occur is the product of the probabilities of the two events.
			- $$P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B)$$
		- If two events are **independent**, that means that one event has no impact on the probability of occurrence of the other event.

			- $$P(B|A) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)} \text{, provided } P(A) > 0$$
			- **Note:** $P(A)$ cannot equal 0, since we know that $A$ *has* occurred.

		- The conditional probability can be rewritten to further generalise the multiplication rule:
			- $$P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B|A)$$
			- $$P(B \cap A) = P(B)B \cdot P(B|A)$$
			- $$\text{As } P(A \cap B) = P(B \cap A) \text{ implies}$$
			- $$P(A) \cdot P(B | A) = P(B) \cdot P(A |B)$$
		- These results mean that $P(A |B)$ can be calculated once we know $P(A)$, $P(B)$, and $P(B | A)$.

			- **Bayes' Theorem** states that:
				- $$P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \text{ for } P(B)>0$$
- ## Independence
	- Two events, $A$ and $B$ are independent, if and only if:
		- $$P(A \cap B) = P(A)\cdot P(B)$$
		- Therefore, to obtain the probability that two independent events will occur, we simply find the product of their individual probabilities.
	- Two events $A$ and $B$ are independent, if and only if:
		- $$P(B | A) = P(B) \text{ or } P(A|B) = P(A)$$
		- assuming the existence of the conditional probabilities.
		- Otherwise, $A$ and $B$ are **dependent**.
	- If in an experiment, the events $A$ and $B$ can both occur, then:
		- $$P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B|A) \text{, provided } P(A) > 0$$
