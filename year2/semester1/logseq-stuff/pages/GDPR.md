		- Cyberattacks are aimed at **accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information**, extorting money, or interrupting normal business processes.
	- Managing sensitive data may reduce the attack probability, or at least its impact.
	- **GDPR** provides such a regulatory framework

		- The **General Data Protection Regulation** is a binding regulation in EU law on data protection in the European Union and the European Economic Area (EEA).
		- The primary aim of GDPR is to ^^enhance individuals' control & rights over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business.^^
		- The regulation contains ^^provisions & requirements related to the processing of personal data of individuals^^ who are located in the EEA, and applies to any enterprise that is processing the personal data of individuals inside the EEA - ^^regardless of its location and the data subjects' citizenship or residence.^^

		  card-last-score:: 5
			- **Accountability** is one of the **data protection principles** -  it makes you responsible for complying with the GDPR and says that ^^you must be able to demonstrate your compliance.^^
			- You need to put in place appropriate technical & organisational measures to meet the requirements of accountability.
			- Accountability requires controllers to maintain records of processing activities in order to demonstrate how they comply with the data protection principles, i.e.:
				- Inventory of personal data
				- Providing assurance of compliance
				- Need to document
					- Why it is held
					- How it is collected

		  card-last-score:: 5
			- A key principle of GDPR is that you process personal data ^^securely by means of "appropriate technical & organisational measures"^^ - this is the "**security principle**".
				- Doing this requires you to consider things like ^^risk analysis, organisational policies, and physical + technical measures.^^
				- Where appropriate, you should look to use measures such as **pseudoanonymisation** and **encryption**.
			- Your measures must ensure the ^^"confidentiality, integrity, & availability"^^ of your systems & services and the personal data you process with them.
			- The measures must also enable you to ^^restore access & availability^^ to personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident.

			- The **Data Processor**
			-
		- What is the **Data Subject**? #card

		  card-last-score:: 5
			- The **Data Subject** is the person to whom the data relates.
			- GDPR only applies to living individuals, but any duty of confidence in place prior to the death extends beyond that point.
				- In Ireland, the next of kin of the deceased are entitled to a Freedom of Information request to the deceased's personal data.
		- What is the **DPO**? #card
		  card-last-interval:: 11.34

		  card-last-score:: 5
			- The primary role of the **Data Protection Officer (DPO)** is to ^^ensure that their organisation processes the personal data of its staff, customers, and other data subjects in compliance with the applicable data protection rules.^^
			- The Data Protection officer is required to be an expert within this field, along with the requirement for them to report to the highest management level.
				- With this being a challenging aspect of GDPR compliance for smaller organisations, there is the option to make an external appointment of a third-part DPO.
			- When is the DPO a mandatory role? #card
			  card-last-interval:: 9.28
			  card-repeats:: 3
			  card-ease-factor:: 2.32

			  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-11-14T16:35:00.574Z
			  card-last-score:: 5
				- The DPO is a mandatory role within 3 different scenarios:
					- 1. When the processing is undertaken by a public authority or body.
					- 2. When an organisation's main activities require the frequent & large-scale monitoring of individual people.
					- 3. Where large-scale processing of special categories of data or data relating to criminal records forms the core activities.

				- A Data Controller needs to have had sufficient training and to be able to competently ensure the security & protection of data held within the organisation.
		- What is the **Data Processor**? #card
		  card-last-interval:: 4.28
		  card-repeats:: 2

		  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-11-18T18:35:18.505Z
		  card-last-score:: 5
			- The **Data Processor** is the person who is ^^responsible for the processing of personal information.^^
			- Generally, this role is undertaken under the instruction of the **data controller**.
				- This might mean obtaining or recording the data, its adaption, and use. It may also include the disclosure of the data or making it available to others.
			- Generally, the Data Processor is involved in the more technical elements of the operation, while the interpretation & main decision-making is the role of the Data Controller.

		- The **Communications Exemption**
		- The **Strictly Necessary Exemption**

		- The **Communications Exemption** applies to cookies ^^whose sole purpose is for carrying out the transmission of a communication over a network^^, for example, to identify the communication endpoints.
		- Cookies that meet these criteria are exempted from being required to ask for the user's consent prior to installation.
		- **Example:** load-balancing cookies that distribute network traffic across different backend servers, also known as **session stickiness**.
			- Here, a **load-balancer** creates an affinity between a client and a specific network server for the duration of a session using a cookie with a random & unique tracking ID.
			- Subsequently, the load-balancer routes all the of the requests from this client to a specific backend server using the tracking ID, for the duration of the session.

		- The **Strictly Necessary** exemption exempts cookies that are strictly necessary to provide the service of delivered over the internet, i.e., a website or app from being required to ask the user's consent prior to installation.
		- ^^This service must have been explicitly requested by the user (i.e., typing in the URL), and the use of the cookie must be restricted to what is strictly necessary to provide that service.^^
		- Cookies related to advertising are **not** strictly necessary, and must be consented to.
		- Examples:
			- A website uses session cookies to keep track of items that a user places in an online shopping basket (assuming that this cookie will be deleted once the session is over).
			- Cookies that a record a user's language or country preference.
