		- **Bootstrap** is a CSS framework.
		- It consists of CSS classes for structure, layout, components (buttons, navbar, modal, etc.), forms, written by other developers.
			- This enforces a uniform layout, look, & feel on the web application.
		- Bootstrap is freely available to develop websites & web applications.
	- JavaScript is also used in conjunction with the CSS classes, for things like animations, transitions, popups, etc.
	- The CSS within Bootstrap is quite detailed, there are lots of classes with varying levels of hierearchy.
	- It's fully customisable & the web is full of themes & templates for apps built using it.
	- ## Adding Bootstrap to our Web Apps
		- Two options:
			- 1. Download the files, i.e., CSS, JS, and place them in the app folders.
			  2. Use a Content Delivery Network URL.

			- A **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** is a popular way to include frontend libraries & technologies.
			- Instead of having a single server, CDNs involve using a collection of servers to serve content.
			- These servers are usually placed geographically close to the user base to ensure that maximum performance is achieved.
			- CDNs are largely designed for delivering static content, images, videos, & web content such as text, graphics, & scripts.
