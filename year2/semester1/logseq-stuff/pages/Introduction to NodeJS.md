- # Background
	- **V8** is an open-source JavaScript engine developed by Google, written in C++ and used in the Google Chrome browser.
	- **Node.js** runs on the V8 engine, written in JavaScript & C++.
		- It's not a programming lanuage - it's a runtime environment.
	- In simple terms, Node.js is "server-side JS".
		- It is a high-performance network applications application that is well-optimised for high concurrent environments.
