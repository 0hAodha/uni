old:
- Ger(n,m) will be on the exam every year

new:
- probably won't be asked to get powers of matrices but probably will be asked *how* you could use powers
- bipartite graphs important, line graphs less so
- won't be asked to calculate eigenvector centrality of nodes in a graph
    - "cruel and unusual"
- betweenness centrality is difficult to calculate in exam situation  
    - might have to explain what it means rather than compute it
- know degree centrality and closeness centrality!
- normalised or not normalised is fine
- graph laplacian will feature only briefly but will
- ER graphs will be on the exam
- no bow tie structure this year
- networkx is mentioned in exam in the exact same way as in the sample paper and no other way
- generate tree from prufer code
