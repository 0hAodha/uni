Week 12 exam run through

Transcript

Last year's paper starting point. And if you go before that like looking at 22, 23 and like this one, you will see that Java's job didn't have been covered because you only joined us more recently.

Okay. And as far as my section is concerned you have to answer two questions out of.

I think three or four questions already have a zero of choice.

Each question has three parts. Now this is different to last year where you basically had one compulsory question and one optional question.

So I left it and instead I kind of revamped this but kind of overall the result would be the same.

So in terms of question what to expect there will be two things.

There will be kind of hands on question stuff we have done in lectures for example including constructing the traffic elective schedule and others basically are more like kind of definitions like having 74 code which if you remember was about reliability and data.

So in a nutshell, if I just. And you can actually expect questions of similar nature in this year's exam paper.

So you know you can expect to see something around Psychic.

Exactly. Scheduling and you can both in terms of scheduling as well as writing bit of code is what you have done in the lecture.

And if there's anything about data about safety reliably reliability engineering which is basically so.

Yeah, that's the one. Modules and here in modules you would have design configuration for real time safety critical.

There are a lot of stuff there. The only relevant bit is data redundancy and everything related between rate empty set forec and and so on so forth.

Bit actually likes the question here and definitely similar question in example previous years.

Okay, okay, so that's, that's. That's important bit and we spent a good bit of time on.

On projects. The POSIX API as well. The POSIX API basically was all this material and there are.

Yes, there are two things. Firstly process like them of course and those two synchronization algorithms we discussed in the lectures here kind of covered there and as you can be sure there will be also another POSIX question and mainly POSIX API.

Now the POSIX API is quite vast so. But what I usually do, I have a certain set of questions about POSIX in my exam paper.

Just look up basically what does the signal API look like for what are signals?

What does it cat. Certain function call loop. Kind of very basic, nothing sinister really. Okay, what else do we have? Cycle effective scheduling Just mentioned about it.

Detail analysis in contrast works quite very simple.

I mean you should know how detail analysis works.

Doesn't more trivial stuff substance. So you know don't worry about this one then overview real time and safety critical systems.

I think the main was a hard real time system or the soft real time system but there were a lot of case studies in there rather than kind of there's very very little in here.

But you will see in previous exam papers I for example question where I asked you the distinction between hard soft, fast, slow real time system maybe provide a few examples but it wouldn't be legally go beyond that.

In this paper we spoke about clock synchronization and there's the whole idea of CAM synchronization maybe using GPS and other GNSS services.

There was a question about this in previous year papers to look at that and first we look into concrete algorithms like for example Berkeley algorithm and Lambda algorithm and vector vector clocks.

So you know and stuff like this is readily covered in exam papers to make sure the other as well.

And I suppose the same applies to PTP and ntp. So we spoke about those two and typically every single example there's either a question about PTP or NTP along lines of this one.

Either way you have to describe certain infrastructure components we have to describe certain elements of the of the protocol in terms of I know how does time simulation actually work so how offset calculated and force or things like how transparent blocks work.

So but again have a look at example from previous years it give you a very good idea.

So that's again nothing sinister there. Also he prepares to you know there could be a question about right from the tuning scheduling and earlier module Electro associates with that which is basically scheduling algorithms for real time systems and have you forgotten everything about this and Electro.

So stuff like this would be could be covered in a question around that.

So yeah, I mean that's basically it overall kind of some questions you have to answer all of 9 or 12 possible questions 2 main questions and you know it should be fairly straightforward.

It's really similar enough to exam papers in previous years anyway but it should be if you know the stuff it shouldn't be too tricky for you.

Okay. If you have any other questions I suppose you can send me an email.

If I can give you more hints I will post them somewhere probably on a discussion for one time or so.

So everybody is kind of on this. I wish you kind of a good look with yourself. I will be there today and if you're not hanging around for another year well good luck with your future career I suppose.

Okay, great. And that's me. Thanks JavaScript okay, so I can explain. There are two sections of the exam, section A and section B.

You'll expect, you know, exactly same thing for section B as well, for my part.

So topics will be from this section, Software, Time Systems and Emerging protocols.

So week seven to week number 12, again you have to attempt two questions out of three from section D.

Similarly from section A, you have to attempt two out of three.

There is no mandatory compulsory question like last year.

So if you see last year's exam, one question was compulsory from each section A and B, but this year we have removed that restriction.

So you can attempt any two out of three questions from each section.

Okay, so don't confuse in that section A two out of three questions, section B, two out of three questions.

Okay, it's not like this. Attempt three from section A and only one from section B is four workers.

So, and then about the topics. So this topic that we are studying this week is excluded from the final exam.

So there's no question from, from 312, but apart from that is like one question from each topic.

So you'll have one question from Software Type Systems, the one we discussed in week number seven when we started.

So talking about RTP protocol, things like voiceover, IP cloud gaming, things like those that are part of this topic.

Then another question is from Demo Protocols. So in Emerging Protocol, if you remember, we discussed, you know, the deficiencies or the weaknesses of HTTP protocol, but it's an old protocol developed in RB19 and you know, what were the performance issues, how it evolved over time.

And then a newer version, HTTP 2 was introduced a few years ago at the application layer.

And then at the transport layer we have Quick Protocol, discuss all those new good features like, you know, lower latency, improved handshake, connection establishment time, all those things that are part of the protocol.

Then next one is about quick condition control. So you can expect a question from this lecture as well to discuss different subdition control algorithms and you know, how Quick Protocol manages that condition material and how is that better than acp, things like those.

Then from logging and visualization we discussed QLog and Q is the two tools.

Why do we need, why we need QLog, how it's better than Wireshark, which we've already used probably for network analysis, network traffic analysis.

And what are the benefits of Cubase tool? What kind of visualization can you do multifaxing or to debug issues with condition control algorithms or multiplexing behavior, things like those.

And finally, yeah, today's lecture, like I said, it's not part of the exam.

So you'll see. Last year there was a question from this exam, but there was no question from topic number one, but no question from performance.

The last one. Anyway, I think I'll write at the end just to be sure.

Okay, so. So yeah, that's it. If you have any questions about the exam. Anyone? No? Okay, so let's start the last topic about web performance benchmarking.

So today and tomorrow we'll try to.
