Old:
- always question about rsa and diffie helman
- don't expecct any diffie helman calculations on the exam, that would be ridiciulous
- "double ratchet algorithm will be covered in exam paper"

New:
2023/2024
- similar to question 2 smaple paper (2023/2024)
    - mode of operation
- any digital certificate question will be like question 3 sample paper
- for design questions, no right or wrong, justify design show thinking
- ipsec question on exa would not go beyond sample paper
    - nothing sinister, nothing complicated
- timing attack question would be along same lines
- seems like basically everything would be "along same lines" - me
- double des, triple des important
- TLS will be on the exam.
    - answer different tls-related terms
    - difference between tls 1.2 and 1.3
    - diagram of handshake
    - authentication
    - keyshare extension
    - nothing sinister, all stuff we have done
- block cipher fundamentals such as s-boxes and p-boxes
    - recurring theme
- LSFR also
    - should understand different stream ciphers
    - maybe come up with a design of your own making

- message authentication
    - things like sequence authentication

2022/2023
- relatively similar
- block modes, lsfrs, block ciphers, public key encryption i.e. diffie helman key exchange
- look at the diffie hellman examples we exercies
- public key will be on the exam
- eliptic curve, diffie hellman
    - have a good working understanding of both
    - hands on understanding of diffie hellman would be useful
        - guess be able to calculate?
- steaganography wont be covered this year
- kerberos was also not covered

lecture notes:
- definitions terminology stuff like that make great questions
    - what is cyber security what is defense in depth what is attacker threat agent hacker
    - briefly describe what the terms mean
    - what is spear phishing
- case studies have no revelance for exam paper
- cia triad
    - good few definitions
    - what is cia triad
- no questions about gdpr
- history of cryptography
    - have a good working understanding of different cryptographic algorithms
        - caesar cipher, monoalphabetic substitution
        - playfair cipher
            - might be quite useful to know how it works
        - rotor ciphre, vigenere cipher
        - differnt attack types
    - don't expect to exercise complicated examples but do need to understand
- no cryptoanalysis question
- block ciphers:
    - what is a block cipher
    - building blocks
    - feistel networks etc
    - typical algs
    - typical modes of operation
- stream ciphers
    - understanding what it does, different ways
    - don't memorise rc4
    - but be able to design your own using lfsr
- data integrity and hash functions and macs important
    - what are hash functions
    - different mode sof operations
    - how to use to ensure integrity
    - characterisitcs, stonrg and weak colision resistance
- hash cracking and rainbow tables not relevant
- public key cryptography
- key distribution
    - don't expect any complicated graphs
    - should understand different methodologies but that's it
    - what's the purpose
    - what approaches to public and private keys
- digital certificates
    - more applied questions
- no openssl
- no code writing
- ipsec
- heartbleed and tls tie together
    - how does tls work
    - bigger picture, bells and whistles tls

= secure network principals
    - very useful if you are asked to design one yourself
    - apply principles to get starting point

- double ratchet will be on exam
    - new question never covered before

- should be fair exam paper
