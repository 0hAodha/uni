\subsection{Introduction to Artificial Intelligence}
The field of Artificial Intelligence has evolved \& changed many times over the years, with changes focussing both on the problems \& approaches in the field;
many problems that were considered typical AI problems are now often considered to belong in different fields.
There are also many difficulties in defining intelligence: the \textbf{Turing test} attempts to give an objective notion of intelligence and abstracts away from any notions of representation, awareness, etc.
It attempts to eliminate bias in favour of living beings by focusing solely on content of questions \& answers.
There are many criticisms of the Turing test:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   Bias towards symbolic problem-solving criticisms;
    \item   Doesn't test many aspects of human intelligence;
    \item   Possibly constrains notions of intelligence.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Approaches to AI}
\begin{itemize}
    \item   \textbf{Classical AI} uses predicate calculus (\& others) and logical inference to infer or find new information.
            It is a powerful approach for many domains, but issues arise when dealing with noise or contradictory data.

    \item   \textbf{Machine learning} learns from data and uses a distributed representation of learned information.
            It is typified by neural networks \& deep learning approaches.

    \item   \textbf{Agent-based systems} view intelligence as a collective emergent behaviour from a large number of simple interacting individuals or \textit{agents}.
            Social systems provide another metaphor for intelligence in that they exhibit global behaviours that enable them to solve problems that would prove impossible for any of the individual members.
            Properties of agent-based systems / artificial life include:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item   Agents are autonomous or semi-autonomous;
                \item   Agents are situated;
                \item   Agents are interactional;
                \item   Society is structured;
                \item   Intelligence is emergent.
            \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Search}
Many problems can be viewed as a \textbf{search} problem;
consider designing an algorithm to solve a sudoku puzzle: in every step, we are effectively searching for a move (an action) that takes us to a correct legal state.
To complete the game, we are iteratively searching for an action that brings us to legal board and so forth until completion.
Other examples include searching for a path in a maze, word ladders, chess, \& checkers.
The problem statement can be formalised as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   The problem can be in various states.
    \item   We start in an initial state.
    \item   There is a set of actions available.
    \item   Each action changes the state.
    \item   Each action has an associated cost.
    \item   We want to reach some goal while minimising cost.
\end{itemize}

More formally:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   There is a set of (possible/legal) states $S$;
    \item   There is some start state $s_0 \in S$;
    \item   There is a set of actions $A$ and action rules $a(s) \rightarrow s'$;
    \item   There is some goal test $g(s) \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ that tests if we have satisfied our goal;
    \item   There is some cost function $C(s,a,s') \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ that associates a cost with each action;
    \item   Search can be defined by the 5-tuple $(S,s,a,g,C)$.
\end{itemize}

We can then state the problem as follows:
find a sequence of actions $a_1 \dots a_n$ and corresponding states $s_0 \dots s_n$ such that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   $s_0 = s$
    \item   $s_i = a_i(S_{i-1})$
    \item   $g(s_n) = 1$
\end{itemize}
while minimising the overall cost $\sum^n_{i=1} c(a_i)$.
\\\\
The problem of solving a sudoku puzzle can be re-stated as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   Sudoku states: all legal sudoku boards.
    \item   Start state: a particular, partially filled-in, board.
    \item   Actions: inserting a valid number into the board.
    \item   Goal test: all cells filled with no collisions.
    \item   Cost function: 1 per move.
\end{itemize}

We can conceptualise this search as a \textbf{search tree}: a node represents a state, and the edges from a state represent the possible actions from that state, with the edge pointing to the new resulting state from the action.
Important factors of a search tree include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   The breadth of the tree (branching factor).
    \item   The depth of the tree.
    \item   The minimum solution depth.
    \item   The size of the tree $O(b^d)$.
    \item   The \textbf{frontier:} the set of unexplored nodes that are reachable from any currently explored node.
    \item   Choosing which node to explore next is the key in search algorithms.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Uninformed Search}
In \textbf{uninformed search}, no information is known (or used) about solutions in the tree.
Possible approaches include expanding the deepest node (depth-first search) or expanding the closest node (breadth-first search).
Properties that must be considered for uninformed search include completeness, optimality, time complexity (the total number of nodes visited), \& space complexity (the size of the frontier).

\begin{code}
\begin{minted}[linenos, breaklines, frame=single, escapeinside=||]{python}
visited = {};
frontier = {|$s_0$|};
goal_found = False;

while (not goal_found):
    node = frontier.next();
    frontier.delete(node);

    if (g(node)):
        goal_found = True;
    else
        visited.add(node);
        for child in node.children():
            if (not visited.contains(child)):
                frontier.add(child);

\end{minted}
\caption{Pseudocode for an uninformed search}
\end{code}

The manner in which we expand the node is key to how the search progresses.
The way in which we implement \mintinline{python}{frontier.next()} determines the type of search; otherwise the basic approach remains unchanged.
\\\\
\textbf{Depth-first search} is good regarding memory cost, but produces suboptimal solutions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   Space: $O(bd)$.
    \item   Time: $O(b^d)$.
    \item   Completeness: only for finite trees.
    \item   Optimality: no.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Breadth-first search} produces an optimal solution, but is expensive with regards to memory cost:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   Space: $O(b^{m+1})$, where $m$ is the depth of the solution in the tree.
    \item   Time: $O(b^m)$.
    \item   Completeness: yes.
    \item   Optimality: yes (assuming constant costs).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Iterative deepening search} attempts to overcome some of the issues of both breadth-first and depth-first search.
It works by running depth-first search to a fixed depth of $z$ by starting at $d=1$ and if no solution is found, incrementing $d$ and re-running.
\begin{itemize}
    \item   Low memory requirements (equal to depth-first search).
    \item   Not many more nodes expanded than breadth-first search.
    \item   Note that the leaf level will have more nodes than the previous layers.
\end{itemize}

Thus far, we have assumed each edge has a fixed cost; consider the case where the costs are not uniform:
neither depth-first search or breadth-first search are guaranteed to find the least-cost path in the case where action costs are not uniform.
One approach is to choose the node with the lowest cost: order the nodes in the frontier by cost-so-far (cost of the path from the start state to the current node) and explore the next node with the smallest cost-so-far, which gives an optimal and complete solution (given all positive costs).

\subsection{Informed Search}
Thus far, we have assumed we know nothing about the search space; what should we do if we know \textit{something} about the search space?
We know the cost of getting to the current node: the remaining cost of finding the solution is the cost from the current node to the goal state; therefore, the total cost is the cost of getting from the start state to the current node, plus the cost of getting from the current node to the goal state.
We can use a (problem-specific) \textbf{heuristic} $h(s)$ to estimate the remaining cost: $h(s) = 0$ is $s$ is a goal.
A good heuristic is fast to compute and close to the real costs.
\\\\
Given that $g(s)$ is the cost of the path so far, the \textbf{A* algorithm} expands the node $s$ to minimise $g(s) + h(s)$.
The frontier nodes are managed as a priority queue.
If $h$ never overestimates the cost, the A* algorithm will find the optimal solution.

\subsection{Adversarial Search}
The typical game setting is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   2 player;
    \item   Alternating turns;
    \item   Zero-sum (gain for one, loss for another);
    \item   Perfect information.
\end{itemize}

A game is said to be \textbf{solved} if an optimal strategy is known.
\begin{itemize}
    \item   A \textbf{strong solved} game is one which is solved for all positions;
    \item   A \textbf{weak solved} game is one which is solved for some (start) positions.
\end{itemize}

A game has the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   A set of possible states;
    \item   A start state;
    \item   A set of actions;
    \item   A set of end states (many);
    \item   An objective function;
    \item   Control over actions alternates.
\end{itemize}

The \textbf{minimax algorithm} computes a value for each node, going backwards from the end-nodes.
The \textbf{max player} selects actions to maximise return, while the \textbf{min player} selects actions to minimise return.
The algorithm assumes perfect play from both players.
For optimal play, the agent has to evaluate the entire game tree.
Issues to consider include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   Noise / randomness;
    \item   Efficiency -- size of the tree;
    \item   Many game trees are too deep;
    \item   Many game trees are too broad.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Alpha-beta pruning} is a means to reduce the search space wherein sibling nodes can be pruned based on previously found values.
Alpha represents the best maximum value found so far (for the maximising player), and beta represents the best minimum value found so far (for the minimising player).
If a node's value proves irrelevant (based on the alpha \& beta values), its entire subtree can be discarded.
In reality, for many search scenarios in games, even with alpha-beta pruning, the space is much too large to get to all end states.
Instead, we use an \textbf{evaluation function} which is effectively a heuristic to estimate the value of a state (the probability of a win or a loss).
The search is ran to a fixed depth and all states are evaluated at that depth.
Look-ahead is performed from the best states to another fixed depth.
\\\\
\textbf{Horizon effects} refer to the limitations that arise when the algorithm evaluates a position based on a finite search depth (the horizon):
\begin{itemize}
    \item   What if something interesting / unusual / unexpected occurs at $\text{horizon}+1$?
    \item   How do you identify that?
    \item   When to generate and explore more nodes?
    \item   Deceptive problems.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Monte Carlo Tree Search}
Minimax and alpha-beta pruning are both useful approaches, and alpha-beta pruning effectively results in computing the square root of the branching factor.
In many cases, however, game trees have too high a \textbf{blocking factor} and evaluating the leaf nodes is not possible; instead, an \textbf{estimation function} is used instead.
\\\\
\textbf{Monte Carlo tree search} continually estimates the value of tree nodes.
It combines ideas from classical tree search with ideas from machine learning, and balances the exploration of unseen space with exploitation of the best known move.
Monte Carlo tree search works by exploring all potential options at the time. 
The best move is identified and other option are searched for while validating how good the current action is.
It uses \textbf{play out}, which is simulation considering random actions.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item   \textbf{Selection:} pick a suitable path.
    \item   \textbf{Expansion:} expand from that path.
    \item   \textbf{Simulation:} simulation / play outs.
    \item   \textbf{Back propagation:} update states.
\end{enumerate}

There is a trade-off between exploration and exploitation; the balance is usually controlled by the number of parameters / factors, including the number of wins, simulations, \& exploration cost.
Monte Carlo grid search is used in a large number of domains, including AlphaGo, DeepMind, \& many video games.

\subsection{Local Search Algorithms}
In many domains, we are only interested in the goal state: the path to finding the goal is irrelevant.
The main idea in \textbf{local search algorithms} is to maintain the current state and repeatedly try to improve upon the current state.
This results in little memory overhead and can find reasonable solutions even in large or infinite spaces.
Local search algorithms are suitable only for certain classes of problems in which maximising (or minimising) certain criteria among a number of candidate solutions is desirable.
Local search algorithms are \textbf{incomplete algorithms}, as they may not find the optimal solution.

\subsection{Hill Climbing}
\textbf{Hill climbing} involves moving in the direction of increasing value and stopping when a peak is reached.
There is no look-ahead involved, and only the current state \& the objective function are maintained.
One problem with hill climbing algorithms is local maxima \& minima; therefore, the success of the algorithm depends on the shape of the search space.
One approach to solve this problem is \textbf{random restart}.

\begin{code}
\begin{minted}[linenos, breaklines, frame=single, escapeinside=||]{python}
current_node = initial_state;

while (stopping_criteria):
    neighbour = current_node.fittest_neighbour;

    if neighbour.value > current_node.value:
        current_node = neighbour;
\end{minted}
\caption{Hill climbing pseudocode}
\end{code}

One problem that can be solved with a hill climbing algorithm is the \textbf{8 queens problem}: place 8 queens on a chess board so that no two queens are attacking each other.
The problem can be stated more formally as: given an 8 $\times$ 8 grid, identify 8 squares so that no two squares are on the same row, column, or diagonal.
The problem can also be generalised to an $N \times N$ board.
An algorithm can be generated using hill climbing to find a solution.
However, it must be noted that the algorithm may get caught at a local maximum.
\\\\
\textbf{Simulated annealing} attempts to avoid getting stuck in local maxima by randomly moving to another state.
The move is based on the fitness of the current state, the new state, and the \textbf{temperature} (a parameter which decreases over time and reduces the probability of changing states).

\subsection{Well-Known Optimisation Problems}
\subsubsection{Knapsack Problem}
There are a set of items, each with a value \& a weight.
The goal is to select a subset of items such that the weight of these items is below a threshold and the sum of the values is optimised / maximised.
The problem is how to select those items.
More formally, given two $n$-tuples of values $< v_0, v_1, \dots, v_n>$ and $<w_0, w_1, \dots, w_n>$, choose a set of items $i$ from the $n$items such that $\sum_i v(i)$ is maximised and $\sum_iw(i) \leq T$.
\\\\
The brute force approach is to enumerate all subsets and keep the subset that gives the greatest payoff: $O(2^n)$.
The greedy approach is more efficient but won't give the best solution.
\\\\
There are many variations on the knapsack problem; the variation described above is the 0/1 knapsack problem;
there are other scenarios where part of an item may be taken, variations wherein there are constraints over the items where the value of an item is dependent on another item being chosen or not, and variations with multiple knapsacks.

\subsection{Travelling Salesman Problem}
Given $N$ cities, devise a tour that involves visiting every city once.
The distance, or \textit{cost}, between pairs of cities is known and the goal is to minimise the cost of the tour.
There are many applications of this problem in scheduling \& optimisation.
\\\\
The brute force approach is to enumerate all tours and choose the cheapest, and is computationally intractable.

\section{Genetic Algorithms}
\textbf{Genetic algorithms} are directed search algorithms inspired by biological evolution, developed by John Holland in the 1970s to study the adaptive processes occurring in natural systems.
They have been used as search mechanisms to find good solutions for a range of problems.
At a high level, the algorithm is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item   Produce an initial population of individuals.
    \item   Evaluate the fitness of all individuals.
    \item   While the termination condition is not met, do:
            \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
                \item   Select the fitter individuals for reproduction.
                \item   Recombine between individuals.
                \item   Mutate individuals.
                \item   Evaluate the fitness of the modified individuals.
                \item   Generate a new population.
            \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

There are many potential options for the representation of chromosomes, including bit strings, integers, real numbers, lists of rules/instructions, \& programs.
To initialise the population, we typically start with a population of randomly generated individuals, but we can also use a previously-saved population, a set of solutions provided by a human expert, or a set of solutions provided by another algorithm.
As rules of thumb, we generally use a data structure as close as possible to the natural representation, write appropriate genetic operators as needed, and, if possible, ensure that all genotypes correspond to feasible solutions.
Selection can be fitness-based (roulette wheel), rank-based, tournament selection, or elitism.
\\\\
\textbf{Crossover} is a vital component of genetic algorithms that allows the recombination of good sub-solutions and speeds up search early in evolution.
\textbf{Mutation} represents a change in the gene; the main purpose is to prevent the search algorithm from becoming trapped in a local maxima.
\\\\
As a simple example, suppose that one wishes to maximise the number of \verb|1|s in a string of $l$ binary digits.
Similarly, we could set the target to be an arbitrary string of \verb|1|s and \verb|0|s.
An individual can be represented as a string of binary digits.
The fitness of a candidate solution is the number of \verb|1|s in its genetic code.
A related problem, maintaining the same representation as before, is to modify the fitness function as follows:
for strings of length $l$ with $x$ \verb|1|s, if $x > 1$, then fitness is equal to $x$; else, fitness is equal to $l+k$ for $k>0$.

\subsection{Schema Theorem}
Consider a genetic algorithm using only a binary alphabet.
$\{0,1,*\}$ is the alphabet, where $*$ is a special wildcard symbol which can be either $0$ or $1$.
A \textbf{schema} is any template comprising a string of these three symbols;
for example the schema $[1*1*]$ represents the following four strings: $[1010]$, $[1011]$, $[1110]$, $[1111]$.
\\\\
The \textbf{order} of a schema $S$ is the number of fixed positions ($0$ or $1$) presented in the schema.
For example, $[01*1*]$ has order $3$, $[1*1*10*0]$ has order $5$.
The order of a schema is useful in estimating the probability of survival of a schema following a mutation.
\\\\
The \textbf{defining length} of a schema $S$ is the distance between the first and last fixed positions in the schema.
For example, the schema $S_1 = [01*1*]$ has defining length $3$.
The defining length of a schema indicates the survival probability of the schema under crossover.
\\\\
Given selection based on fitness, the expected number of individuals belonging to a schema $S$ at generation $i+1$ is equal to the number of them present at generation $i$ multiplied by their fitness over the average fitness.
An ``above average'' schema receives an exponentially increasing number of strings over the evolution.
The probability of a schema $S$ surviving crossover is dependent on the defining length: schemata with above-average fitness with short defining lengths will still be sampled at exponentially increasing rates.
The probability of a schema $S$ surviving mutation is dependent on the order of the schema: schemata with above-average fitness with low orders will still be sampled at exponentially increasing rates.
\\\\
The \textbf{schema theorem} states that short, low-order, above-average schemata receive exponentially increasing representation in subsequent generations of a genetic algorithm.
The \textbf{building-block hypothesis} states that a genetic algorithm navigates the search space through the re-arranging of short, low-order, high-performance schemata, termed \textit{building blocks}.

\subsection{Landscapes}
A \textbf{landscape} is a visualisation of the relationship between genotype \& fitness;
it can give an insight into the complexity of the problem at hand.
Landscapes can be adaptive.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./images/landscape.png} \caption{Fitness landscape example. The peaks on the landscape represent high fitness and hence the ability of the genotype to survive. The valleys or troughs indicate low fitness.}
\end{figure}

An \textbf{NK fitness landscape} is a model of genetic interactions, developed to explain \& explore the effects of local features on the ruggedness of a fitness landscape -- \textit{ruggedness} plays a key roles in ascertaining how difficult it is to find the global optimum.
NK landscapes allow us to tune the ruggedness.
Each component (gene) of the solution space makes a contribution to the fitness;
the contribution to the landscape depends on the value of that gene itself but also on the state of $K$ other nodes, where $K$ can be changed to give different landscapes.
If $K=0$, all genes are independent and this is typically a smooth multi-modal landscape; as $K$ increases, the landscape becomes more rugged.
\\\\
One approach to create NK fitness landscapes is to use a \textit{lookup table} of size $2^K$ where each row in the lookup table represents the neighbourhood values and the fitness achieved.
Variations on NK fitness landscapes can be made by using non-uniform interaction sizes or allowing non-adjacent genes to influence each other's fitness.
\\\\
\textbf{Fitness clouds} can be created by randomly sampling the population, generating $K$ mutated versions of the sampled genotypes, measuring their fitness, and plotting their fitness over time, thus giving insight into the landscape.

\subsection{Objective/Fitness Functions}
We usually specify the objective in the fitness function, for example, the thing we are trying to maximise or minimise or some constraint that we want to satisfy.
This can be very difficult, and sometimes we don't even know how to specify the function;
furthermore, fitness functions can be costly to evaluate.
Issues arise with this:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   ``Most ambitious objectives don't illuminate a path to themselves.''
    \item   ``Many great discoveries are not the result of objective-driven search.''
    \item   ``Natural evolution innovates through an open-ended process that lacks a final objective.''
    \item   ``Searching for a fixed objective, the dominant paradigm in EC and ML, may ultimately limit what can be achieved.''
\end{itemize}

The more ambitious the objective fitness function, the less likely it is that evolution will solve it.
The two big issues with fitness landscapes (neutral plains and ruggedness) can both be attributed, at least in part, to the fitness function

\subsection{Diversity}
It's important to maintain diversity in the population for genetic algorithms.
Once a population converges on a local optima, it can be difficult to introduce sufficient diversity to climb out of local optima.
Many approaches have been proposed to maintain diversity.
If diversity decreases, then a big increase in mutation levels called \textbf{hypermutation} can be used in the hopes of introducing novelty.
Then, we need some measure of diversity: it can be measured at the genotypic, phenotypic, or fitness levels.
\\\\
\textbf{Co-evolution} is often used as a means to help diversity where interactions between individuals contribute to the fitness with the goal that a form of competition will lead to better performance.
Alternative representations can also be used to encourage greater diversity by building redundancy into the representation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   \textbf{Multi-layered GA:} add an extra layer or layers between the genotype and the phenotype, thus allowing multiple genotypes to map to a phenotype.
            This can allow multiple mutations to occur which aren't immediately represented in the phenotype, maintaining increased diversity.

    \item   \textbf{Diploid representations:} represent each chromosome by two genetic sequences, one of which is subject to evolutionary pressures, the pother following a random walk.
            Periodically, a small percentage of chromosomes swap their sequences.

    \item   \textbf{Island models for the GA:} partition the population of solutions into sub-groups, with each sub-group evolving separately.
            Periodically, some solutions are swapped among the separate populations.
\end{itemize}

Several approaches have been attempted to make the rates of mutation and crossover subject to evolution itself: \textbf{self-adaptation}.
For example, add a gene to each chromosome which represents the rate at which mutation should be applied to that chromosome or solution.
The goal is that the evolutionary process itself will find a suitable mutation rate.

\subsection{Novelty Search}
The central thesis of \textbf{novelty search} is that by solely evolving according to an objective function, we decrease creativity, novelty, \& innovation.
It argues that this is because many objective functions are deceptive and that we should instead reward solutions (or sub-solutions) that are unique and phenotypically novel.
It has been successfully applied in a range of domains including the evolution of movement for robots.
In many domains, novelty search has out-performed searching directly for an objective.
The standard approach to novelty search involves maintaining an archive of previously-found novel solutions.
To decide are the size of the archive, the similarity measure, and the balance between novelty \& fitness.

\section{Game Theory}
\subsection{Reasoning about Interactions}
Assume that we have just two agents, $i$ and $j$, and that these agents are self-interested.
Let there be a set of ``outcomes'' $\Omega = \{ \Omega_1, \Omega_2, \dots, \Omega_n \}$ over which the agents have preferences.
Preferences are expressed by utility functions:
\begin{align*}
    u_i& : \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \\
    u_j& : \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \\
\end{align*}

These functions lead naturally to preference orderings over outcomes:
\begin{align*}
    \Omega \geq u_i \Omega' \rightarrow u_i(\Omega) \geq u_i(\Omega')
\end{align*}

We need a model of the environment in which agents can act.
Let us assume agents act simultaneously to choose an action to perform, and as a result of the actions an outcome will result.
The actual outcome depends on the combination of actions.
This can be represented as a \textbf{state transformation function}:
\begin{align*}
    \tau: \text{Action}_i \times \text{Action}_j \rightarrow \Omega
\end{align*}

For the time being, we will make the simplifying assumption that an agent can make one of two actions: to co-operate $C$ or to defect $D$.
We say a certain move is \textbf{rational} if the outcomes that arise through the action are better than all outcomes that arise from the alternative action.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./images/rationalchoice.png}
    \caption{For player $j$, $D$ is the rational choice}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Dominant Strategy}
Given a particular strategy $s$ for agent $i$, there will be a number of possible outcomes.
We say $s_1$ dominates $s_2$ if every outcome possible by agent $i$ playing $s_1$ is preferred over every possible outcome by agent $i$ playing $s_2$.
A rational agent will never play a dominated strategy.
However, there is not usually a unique undominated strategy.

\subsection{Nash Equilibrium}
Two strategies $s_1$ and $s_2$ are in \textbf{Nash equilibrium} if:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   Assuming agent $i$ plays $s_1$, agent $j$ can do no better than play $s_2$; and
    \item   Assuming agent $j$ plays $s_2$, agent $i$ can do no better than play $s_1$.
\end{itemize}

In Nash equilibrium, neither agent has any incentive to deviate from their strategy.
Not all possible interactions have a Nash equilibrium, and some interactoins can have several Nash equilibria.

\subsection{Prisoner's Dilemma}
The \textbf{Prisoner's Dilemma} is usually expressed in terms of pay-offs (or rewards) for co-operating or defecting:

\[
\begin{array}{c c|c c}
  & & \text{Player } j & \\
  & & \text{C} & \text{D} \\
\hline
  \text{Player } i & \text{C} & (3, 3) & (0, 5) \\
                  & \text{D} & (5, 0) & (1, 1)
\end{array}
\]

\begin{itemize}
    \item   If both co-operate, they each get a reward of 3.
    \item   If both defect, they each get a reward of 1.
    \item   If one co-operates and the other defects, the com-operators gets 0 (the sucker's payoff) and the other gets 5.
\end{itemize}

The individually rational action is to defect:
it guarantees a payoff of no worse than 1, whereas co-operating guarantees a payoff of no worse than 0.
So, defection is the best response to all strategies;
however, common sense indicates that this is not the best response.
\\\\
The prisoner's dilemma occurs in many domains and is suitable for modelling large classes of multi-agent interactions.
There have been many real-world scenarios that are implicitly prisoner's dilemmas (or variations):
\begin{itemize}
    \item   Arms race;
    \item   Environmental issues;
    \item   Free-rider systems;
    \item   Warfare;
    \item   Behaviour in many biological systems --- bats, guppie fish, etc;
    \item   Competition between nodes in a distributed computer system;
    \item   Modelling competition and collaboration between information providers;
    \item   Sports.
\end{itemize}

Variations on the prisoner's dilemma include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   \textbf{$N$-player dilemma:} for example, the voter's paradox, where it is true that a particular endeavour would return a benefit to all members where each individual would receive rewards;
            it is also true that any member would receive an even greater reward by contributing nothing.
            Elections, environment actions, and the tragedy of the commons are all examples of this phenomenon.

    \item   \textbf{Spatial organisations:} where agents are placed in some 2-dimensional space and can only interact with neighbours.

    \item   \textbf{Partial co-operation:} acts are no longer co-operative or non-co-operative, but can be in some range.
            If we consider extending the classical IPD to this domain, we can define landscapes using pay-off equations.

    \item   \textbf{Noise:} problems arise if we introduce any degree of noise, which will lead co-operations to be interpreted as defections, etc.
            Consider two TFTs playing witha  degree of noise.
\end{itemize}

Summay so far:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   We need a means to organise \& co-ordinate agents.
            There are underlying problems here with respect to co-operation.

    \item   Game theory \& extensions provides a tool to reason about and to develop multi-agent systems.

    \item   We assume agents have a rational ordering of possible outcomes and a set of actions they may choose to bring about those outcomes.

    \item   We have limited the types of interactions to very simple cases.
\end{itemize}

One extension is the \textbf{ultimatum game}.
We are no longer just discussing outcomes for simple choices:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   Two players $i$ and $j$.
    \item   The goal is to distribute some resource, e.g., โฌ100.
    \item   Player $i$ picks a number $x$, in a range (0-100).
    \item   Player $j$ must accept or reject the offer.
    \item   If Player $j$ rejects: both get 0.
    \item   If Player $j$ accepts: Player $i$ gets $x$ and Player $j$ gets $100-x$.
\end{itemize}

This allows us to reason about more complex scenarios.
Many extensions are available and have been researched.
If we wish to reason about two or more agents/systems agreeing on value for some exchange (information, service), we can look to auction theory.
To reason about more complex scenarios, negotiation \& argumentation theory has been adopted.

\subsection{Auction Theory}
\textbf{Auction theory} can be used as a method to allow agents to arrive at an agreement regarding events \& actions when agents are self-interested.
In some cases, no agreement is possible at all.
However, in most scenarios, there is the potential to arrive at a mutually beneficial agreement.
There are several approaches that have been adopted to do this;
all can bee seen as a form of negotiation or argumentation by the agents.
Negotiation or argumentation is governed by some protocol or mechanism:
this protocol defines how the agents are to interact, i.e., the actual rules of encounter.
Questions that arise include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   How to design a protocol such that certain properties exist?
    \item   How to design strategies for agents to use a given set of protocols?
\end{itemize}

Desired features from protocols include: guaranteed success, simplicity, maximising social utility, pareto-efficiency, \& individual rationality.
\textbf{Auctions} represent a class of useful protocols, and are used in many domains.
An auction takes place between an agent (auctioneer) and a set of other agents (bidders).
The goal is to allocate the goods to one of the bidders.
Usually, an auctioneer attempt to maximise the price;
the bidders desire to minimise the price.
We can categorise auctions according to a range of features:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   Bids may be:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item   Open-cry;
                \item   Sealed bid.
            \end{itemize}

    \item   Bidding may be:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item   One shot;
                \item   Ascending;
                \item   Descending.
            \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Selling goods by auction is more flexible than setting a fixed price and less time-consuming than explicit negotiation (haggling).
In many domains, the value of an item may vary enough to preclude direct \& absolute pricing.
It is a pure form of market;
it is efficient in that auctions usually ensure goods are allocated to those who value them most.
The price is set, not by the sellers, but by the buyers.
No one auction protocol is the best;
some are preferred by sellers, others by buyers.
Some auctions attempt to prevent cheating, or at least decrease the incentive to cheat;
others provide several means to cheat.
People tend to bid in auctions for two reasons:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   They wish to acquire the goods (bases bid on private evaluation).
    \item   They wish to acquire the goods to re-sell (bases bid on private evaluation and estimates on future valuations).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{English Auction}
In an \textbf{English auction}, the auctioneer begins with the lowest acceptable price (reserve), and proceeds to obtain successively higher bids from bidders until no-one will increase the bid.
It is effectively first-price, open-cry, \& ascending.
The dominant strategy is to successively bid a small amount more than the current highest id until it reaches their valuation, then withdraw.
Potential problems with English auctions include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   Rings;
    \item   Shills in the bidders;
    \item   Winner's curse.
\end{itemize}

In some English auctions, the reserve price is kept secret to attempt to prevent rings from forming.

\subsubsection{Dutch Auction}
In a \textbf{Dutch auction}, bidding starts at an artificially high price.
Lower prices are offered, in descending order, until a bidder equals to the current price.
Goods are then sold to the bidder for that price
Dutch auctions are descending, open-cry auctions.
From a seller's perspective, the key to a successful auction is the effect of competition on the bidders.
In an English auction, a winner may pay well under their valuation and thus the seller loses out;
this is not the case in a Dutch auction.

\subsubsection{First-Price, Sealed Bid}
\textbf{First-price, sealed bid} auctions are usually one-shot auctions.
Each bidders submits a sealed bid.
The goods are sold to the highest bidders.
Best strategy is to bid to true valuation.
Interesting variations exist if there are a number of goods to be sold and a number of rounds.

\subsubsection{Vickrey Auction}
A \textbf{Vickrey auction} is a sealed-bid, second-price auction.
The price paid by the winner is that price offered by the second-placed bidder.
In this type of auction, contrary to initial intuition, sellers make as much, if not more than the first-price auctoins.
In reality, bidders are not afraid to bid high, knowing that they will have to pay the second price;
bidders tend to be more competitive.
\\\\
Other auction types exist also: reverse auctions, double auctions, haphazard (whisper auction, handshake auction), etc.
We can use auctions as a means to allow agents to agree on a price for buying goods or services.
Depending on the type of auction chosen, we will favour buyers or sellers.
We sill have some problems though:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   Are auctions the best way?
    \item   What happens following an auction, if upon receiving goods, one doesn't pay?
    \item   What happens following an auction, if upon paying, one realise that the goods are not as expected?
    \item   Is it possible to prevent shills, rings, \& other forms of manipulation?
    \item   In auctions, agents agree on a price; can we deal with more dimensions of negotiation?
\end{itemize}

\section{Automated Negotiation}
\textbf{Negotiation} is a means for a group to arrive at an agreement.
It is a process of joint decision-making where parties with different preferences seek to reach a mutually acceptable solution.
It is a fundamental mechanism in multi-agent systems \& human society.
Negotiation research deals with three topics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   Negotiation protocols;
    \item   Negotiation objects; \&
    \item   Agents' decision-making models.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Negotiation Protocols}
\textbf{Negotiation protocols} are a set of rules that govern the interaction:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   Includes the permitted type of participants;
    \item   Negotiation states;
    \item   Events that change states;
    \item   Actions of participants;
    \item   Rules for agreement formation; \&
    \item   Termination conditions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Negotiation Objects}
\textbf{Negotiation objects} consist of a range of issues over which agreement must be reached.
Related issues include the type of operations on agreements and altering the structure of the negotiation. 

\subsection{Agents' Decision-Making Models}
The \textbf{agents' decision-making models} are influenced by protocol, the nature of the negotiation objects, \& the range of operations.
The relative importance of the components varies depending on the domain.

\subsection{Domain Variation in Negotiation}
In some domains, the negotiation protocol is the dominant concern.
For example, in some auction settings, the best strategy for an agent is to bid to their true evaluation --- hence no strategic analysis is really required.
In other domains, the converse is true;
given the wide range of possibilities, there is no best technique for automated negotiation.

\subsection{Negotiation as Distributed Search}
Negotiation can be viewed as a \textbf{distributed search} through a space of potential agreements;
the dimensionality \& topology of this space is determined by the structure of the negotiation object.
One could consider each attribute of the negotiation object to have a separate dimension associated with it.
As dimensions are added (or removed), the number of points of agreement may increase (or decrease).
Similarly, if an agent changes one of the values, it is moving from one point in the agreement space to another.
\\\\
In a negotiation, participants are the active components that determine the direction of the search.
Initially, each agent will have a portion of the space in which it will be willing to make an agreement.
Also, agents will have some means to rate the points in the space.
Negotiation involves the agents suggesting points or spaces.

\subsection{Minimal Negotiation Capabilities}
The \textbf{minimal negotiation capabilities} are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   To propose some point of space as being acceptable; \& 
    \item   To respond to such a proposal by indicating whether or not it is acceptable.
\end{itemize}

A simple setting is a Dutch auction:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   One agent (the auctioneer) calls out prices.
    \item   If there is no signal of acceptance by an agent, then the auctioneer makes a new offer which it believes will be more acceptable.
    \item   The process repeats.
\end{itemize}

If agents can only accept or reject offers, the negotiation will be very time-consuming \& inefficient.
The proposer is effectively picking points in the agreement space based on what it perceives \& hopes to stumble upon correct point. 
For negotiation to be more efficient, the recipient needs to offer feedback.

\subsection{Feedback in Negotiation}
\textbf{Feedback} can be a critique, or a counter-proposal.
A \textbf{critique} provides two forms of feedback:
it suggests constraints on issues, and indicates acceptation or rejection of particular negotiation issues.
The more information placed in the critique, the easier it is for the original agent to determine the boundaries of the agreement space.
\\\\
A \textbf{counter-proposal} is a proposal that is more favourable to the sender, made in response to a previous proposal.
It can suggest amendments or additions, provides implicit information about preferences, and can significantly speed up the negotiation process.

\subsection{Limitations of Simple Proposals}
Proposals, critiques, \& counter-proposals are mere statements of what the agents want; hence, the scope is confined.
Agents can't justify their negotiation stance or persuade one another to change the negotiation stance.
This leads to the idea of \textbf{argumentation-based negotiation}: allow agents to offer more information than available proposals, critiques, \& counter-proposals.

\subsection{Approaches to Negotiation}
Approaches to reasoning in a negotiation setting can be loosely categorised as game-theoretic, heuristic, or argumentation-based.

\subsubsection{Game-Theoretic Approach}
The \textbf{game-theoretic approach} can be applied in two manners:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   Designing appropriate protocols that will govern agent's interactions; \&
    \item   Design of a particular agent's strategy.
\end{itemize}

Properties of the game-theoretic approach include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   We usually assume that a rational agent will choose the best strategy;
    \item   Finding the best strategy can be computationally intractable; \&
    \item   Disadvantages include that it may be difficult to characterise agent's preferences with respect to all possible outcomes.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Heuristic Approach}
The \textbf{heuristic approach} seeks to search the negotiation space in a non-exhaustive fashion.
It produces good solutions rather than optimal solutions.
Disadvantages of the heuristic approach include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   Sub-optimality: it adopts an approximate notion of rationality and does not fully examine the negotiation space;
    \item   Models need extensive analysis true simulation; \&
    \item   It is usually difficult to predict behaviour.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Argumentation-Based Approach}
In the \textbf{argumentation-based approach}, agents aim to persuade or change the opponent's ratings over the agreement space.
Additional information is provided in addition to proposals, etc., usually taking the form of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   \textbf{Threats:} ``if you don't accept, I'll have to...'';
    \item   \textbf{Rewards:} ``if you accept this offer, in the future I'll...''; \&
    \item   \textbf{Appeals:} ``this is standard practice in our industry...''.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Extended Topics in Negotiation}
\subsubsection{Learning in Negotiation}
Agents can adapt strategies based on past interactions.
Types of learning:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   Learning opponent's preferences;
    \item   Learning effective negotiation strategies; \&
    \item   Learning from past negotiation outcomes.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Trust \& Reputation}
\textbf{Trust \& reputation} are critical when agreements must be enforced overtime.
\textbf{Trust} models help agents to decide with whom to negotiate.
\textbf{Reputation} systems aggregate experiences across multiple agents.
There are mechanisms for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   Preventing reneging on agreements;
    \item   Handling deception in negotiation; \&
    \item   Building long-term relationships.
\end{itemize}

\section{Communication in Agent-Based Systems}
We have considered mechanisms for agents to interact:
mechanisms such as auction protocols or negotiation protocols allow agents to hopefully reach an agreement.
In order to do so, agents need to be able to communicate in an expressive manner.
Many approaches to communication in (multi-)agent systems are inspired by Austin's work in \textbf{Speech-Act Theory} (1962);
speech-act theories are pragmatic theories of how language is used to achieve goals and / or intentions.
Austin argued that many utterances are similar to physical actions in that they bring about a change in the state of the world, e.g., ``you're fired''.
More generally, things human utter are done so with the intention of satisfying some goal, for example, asking a question, answering a question, making a request.
A theory of how utterances are to achieve intentions is a speech-act theory.
\\\\
John Searle (1969) classified types of speech acts as:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item   \textbf{Representatives:} such as informing, e.g., ``it is cold'';
    \item   \textbf{Directives:} attempts to get the listener to do something, e.g., ``please pass the beer'';
    \item   \textbf{Commissives:} which commit the speaker to doing something, e.g., ``I promise to pay...'';
    \item   \textbf{Expressives:} whereby a speaker expresses a mental state, e.g., ``thank you''.
    \item   \textbf{Declarations:} such as declaring war.
\end{enumerate}

We can view a speech act as having two components:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item   A performative verb (e.g., to request, inform, promise, etc.).
    \item   Propositional content (e.g., ``the light is on'').
\end{enumerate}

We can have the same content but the meaning is different depending on the performative.
Consider, for example, the content ``\textit{the light is on}'':

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Performative}   & \textbf{Content}          & \textbf{Speech Act} \\
    \hline
    Request                 & ``\textit{the light is on}''  & ``Please turn on the light.'' \\
    \hline
    Inform                  & ``\textit{the light is on}''  & ``The light is on!'' \\
    \hline
    Inquire                 & ``\textit{the light is on}''  & ``Is the light on?'' \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}   
    \caption{Same content, different meanings}
\end{table}

Questions arise as to how to define the semantics of a speech act.
The semantics of speech acts can be formalised using a set of pre-conditions \& post-conditions.
For example, when considering a ``request'' speech act, there are certain things that should be true prior to the request and a set of things that should be true following the request.
The semantics for a request are as follows:
\begin{align*}
    \text{request}(a, b, X) \quad \text{(i.e., agent } a \text{ asks agent } b \text{ to do } X \text{)}
\end{align*}

The pre-conditions are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   $a$ believes $b$ can do $X$;
    \item   $a$ believes $b$ believes $b$ can do $X$;
    \item   $a$ believes $a$ wants $X$.
\end{itemize}

The post conditions are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   $b$ believes that $a$ believes $a$ wants $X$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Agent Communication Languages (ACLs)}
There have been several attempts to create \textbf{Agent Communication Languages (ACLs)} based on speech-act theory, e.g., KQML, FIPA ACL.
\textbf{KQML} is comprised of tow parts:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   The knowledge query \& manipulation language (KQML); \& 
    \item   The knowledge interchange format (KIF).
\end{itemize}

KQML allows one to define various acceptable ``communicative verbs'' or performatives.
Examples include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   \verb|ask-if|: (``is it true that...'');
    \item   \verb|perform|: (``please perform the following action...'');
    \item   \verb|tell|: (``is it true that...'');
    \item   \verb|reply|: (``the response is...'');
\end{itemize}

KIF Is a language for expressing the content of the messages.
\\\\
\textbf{FIPA} allows \verb|inform| \& \verb|request| as basic primitives:

\begin{code}
\begin{minted}[linenos, breaklines, frame=single, escapeinside=||]{lisp}
(inform
:sender agent1
:receiver agent2
:content (price item3 250)
:language scheme
:ontology art-auction
)
\end{minted}
\caption{Example FIPA \texttt{inform} request} \end{code}

\section{Artificial Life}
\textbf{Artificial life} is the study of man-made systems that exhibit behaviours characteristic of natural living systems.
It involves the investigation of the essence of life \& the ability to construct life or life-like systems, and the investigation of biological / naturally-occurring systems.
It attempts to develop life-like behaviours \& properties from simple rules \& interactions.
The core principle of artificial life is creating complex behaviours from simple rules \& interactions. 
\\\\
Artificial life has connections with many existing fields:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   Physics;
    \item   Artificial intelligences;
    \item   Computer science;
    \item   Social science;
    \item   Philosophy;
    \item   Psychology.
\end{itemize}

It has been explored as a means to understand the emergence of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   Language;
    \item   Order;
    \item   Culture --- norms, artefacts;
    \item   Social structures.
\end{itemize}

Modelling approaches include simulation, robotics, \& virtual environments, while key areas of study include emergence, self-organisation, adaptation, evolution, \& collective behaviour.
Many models of creatures \& animals have been built in robotics \& in simulation which allows the exploration of the issues of co-operation \& competition in these ``species''.

\subsection{Cellular Automata}
A \textbf{cellular automaton (CA)} is a model of a parallel compute, consisting of \textit{processors} (cells), usually connected in an $n$-dimensional grid.
Cellular automata are characterised by very simple rules and potentially very complex emergent behaviours;
very simple rules govern interactions between neighbouring cells but give rise to recognisable groups of patterns, including static, dynamic, mobile, \& cyclic patterns.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./images/typesofcellularautomata.png}
    \caption{ Types of cellular automata }
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{John von Neumann's Universal Constructor}
John von Neumann's \textbf{universal constructor} is a self-replicating machine existing in a cellular environment developed by Jon von Neumann in the 1940s with the aim of specifying an abstract machine which, when ran, would replicate itself.
The original experiment was created to see if a simple rule system could create a \textbf{universal computer}, a Turing machine capable of emulating any kind of information processing through a simple rule system.
It was the first theoretical demonstration that self-reproduction based on on logical rules was possible.

\subsubsection{Conway's Game of Life}
\textbf{Conway's Game of Life} is a simple mathematical game where patterns unfold according to a set of rules.
It is a form of cellular automata, and consists of a rectangular grid of ``living'' (on) \& ``dead'' (off) cells.
Complex patterns result from simple structures.
Three simple rules govern the Game of Life:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item   \textbf{Loneliness:} live cell dies if it has fewer than two live neighbours.
    \item   \textbf{Overcrowding:} a live cell dies if it has more than three live neighbours.
    \item   \textbf{Reproduction:} a dead cell becomes alive if it has exactly three live neighbours.
\end{enumerate}

From these simple rules emerge structures, oscillators, gliders, \& even computational elements.

\subsubsection{Computational Properties of Cellular Automata}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./images/cellularneighbourhoods.png}
    \caption{ Different neighbourhoods are possible in cellular automata }
\end{figure}

There are many open questions about the computational properties of cellular automata:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   What kind of patterns will emerge given a certain starting pattern?
    \item   Update rules and their effect?
    \item   Can CA be used to perform computation?
\end{itemize}

Stephen Wolfram put forward 4 classifications:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item   Class 1: evolution leads to a stable homogeneous state.
    \item   Class 2: evolution leads to a simple stable or periodic structures.
    \item   Class 3: evolution leads to chaotic patterns.
    \item   Class 4: evolution leads to complex structures with long transients.
\end{enumerate}

There are similar emergent properties witnessed in evolutionary spatial game theory and in models \& simulations of multi-agent systems. 

\subsection{Ant Colonies}
\textbf{Ant colonies} are distributed systems of social insects, consisting of simple individuals with limited ``processing'' capabilities.
The intelligence of the colony is far greater than the intelligence of the individuals, due to emergent intelligence through simple local interactions.
Ant colonies have been studied in detail, and exhibit lots of properties desirable in computational systems:
responsive to changes in environment, robust solutions, task decomposition \& allocation.
\\\\
Complex tasks are broken down into simpler sub-tasks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   Leaf-cutting;
    \item   Transportation;
    \item   Transformation to pulp \& pellets;
    \item   Planting fungi into pellets;
    \item   Tending to pellets.
\end{itemize}

There are several million ants per colony working collectively;
tasks are assigned based on local conditions and the needs of the colony.
Individual ants can switch roles as needed.
There is \textbf{emergent organisation}: without central control, ants self-organise into efficient work groups.

\subsubsection{Self-Organisation}
\textbf{Self-organisation} is a set of dynamical mechanisms whereby structure appears at the global level as the result of interactions among lower-level components.
The rules specifying the interactions among the constituent units of the system are executed based on purely local information.
The four basic ingredients of self-organisation are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item   Multiple interactions;
    \item   Randomness;
    \item   Positive feedback;
    \item   Negative feedback.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Indirect Communication in Ant Colonies}
\textbf{Stigmergy} is co-ordination through environment modification.
Ants deposit \textbf{pheromone trails} as they travel;
the strength of the trial indicates \textit{desirability} and the trails evaporate over time (\textit{negative feedback}).
When presented with two paths, ants collectively select the shorter one, demonstrating collective problem-solving capability (double bridge experiments, Deneubourg).
\\\\
Indirect communication is mediated by modifications of environmental states which are only locally accessible by the communicating agents.
Features of \textbf{artificial stigmergy} include indirect communication \& local accessibility.
Ant algorithms are multi-agent systems that exploit artificial stigmergy as a means for co-ordinating artificial ants for the solution of computational problems, such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   Shortest path;
    \item   Network routing;
    \item   Task allocation of labour;
    \item   Robotics \& co-ordination;
    \item   Graph partitioning.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Ant Colony Optimisation}
Ideas from ant colony optimisation can be mapped to a \textit{search algorithm}, originally applied to the Travelling Salesman Problem but can eb applied to a range of optimisation problems.
An overview of the algorithm is as follows, although there are many extensions \& variants:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item   Ants initially perform a random walk on the graph, leaving a pheromone trail as they walk.
            Domain knowledge or heuristics can be included on the edges of the graph.
    \item   Ants are placed on cities randomly.
    \item   Choose paths through the graph (initially random).
    \item   Update the pheromone level as a function of the solution quality.
\end{enumerate}

The probability of an ant $k$ at node $i$ choosing to move to node $j$ is:
\begin{align*}
    p^{k}_{ij} =
    \begin{cases}
        \frac{[\tau_{ij}]^\alpha \cdot [\eta_{ij}]^\beta}{\sum_{l \in N_i^k} [\tau_{il}]^\alpha \cdot [\eta_{il}]^\beta} & \text{if } j \in N^k_i \\
        0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{align*}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   $\tau{ij}$ is the pheromone intensity on edge $(i,j)$;
    \item   $\eta_{ij}$ is the heuristic information (typically $\eta_{ij} = \frac{1}{d_ij}$ where $d_{ij}$ is the distance);
    \item   $\alpha$ \& $\beta$ are parameters controlling the relative importance of pheromone versus heuristic;
    \item   $N_i^k$ is the set of feasible nodes for ant $k$ when at node $i$.
\end{itemize}

The pheromone intensity influence which edges are followed.
The value $\tau_{ij}$ on edge $(i,j)$ is updated periodically, based on two factors:
evaporation \& reinforcement.

\subsubsection{Swarm Intelligence in Other Species}
Similar phenomena have been identified in other species:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   Termites: complex nest-building behaviour, temperature \& humidity regulation;
    \item   Honeybees: nest location identification \& decision-making, several scouts explore \& decisions are made through communication, waggle dance for communicating food sources;
    \item   Bird flocking \& fish schooling: simple rules of separation, alignment, \& cohesion, create complex \& co-ordinated movement patterns.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Digital Evolution Systems}
\begin{itemize}
    \item   Avida: digital platform for studying evolution.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item   Digital organisms compete for resources;
                \item   Mutations affect their ability to process information;
                \item   Natural selection emerges without being explicitly programmed.
            \end{itemize}

    \item   Tierra: created by Thomas Ray.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item   Self-replicating computer programs;
                \item   Programs evolve, compute for CPU time;
                \item   Parasites, immunity, \&  other biological phenomena emerge.
            \end{itemize}

    \item   Polyworld: artificial ecosystem with 3D physics.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item   Organisms with neural networks as brains;
                \item   Evolution of complex behaviours \& strategies.
            \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Neural Networks}
\subsection{Biological Underpinnings}
\textbf{Neurons} are specialised cells that process \& transmit information.
The structure of neurons include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   \textbf{Soma}: the cell body which contains the nucleus and processes inputs;
    \item   \textbf{Dendrites:} receives signals from other neurons;
    \item   \textbf{Axon:} transmits signals to other neurons;
    \item   \textbf{Synapses:} connection points between neurons.
\end{itemize}

The human brain contains over 80 billion neurons.
Each neuron may connect to thousands of other.
Signals can be \textbf{excitatory} (increase firing probability) or \textbf{inhibitory} (decrease firing probability).
\\\\
An \textbf{artificial neuron} has input connections to receive signals, an activation function (sigmoid, ReLU, etc.) that activates depending on the weighted sum of the inputs, and transmits the result on the output connection.
Artificial neurons have weighted connections to other neurons.
They learn through backpropagation and are used in parallel computing architectures.
Key simplifications made in the artificial neural network model include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   Discrete time steps instead of continuous firing;
    \item   Simplified activation functions;
    \item   Uniform neuron types instead of diverse cell types;
    \item   Backpropagation instead of local learning rules.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{History of Artificial Neural Networks}
\begin{itemize}
    \item   \textbf{1934:} McCulloch \& Pitts proposed the first mathematical model of a neuron, with binary threshold units performing logical operations, and demonstrated that networks of these neurons could compute any arithmetic or logical function.

    \item   \textbf{1949:} Donald Hebb published \textit{The Organisation of Behaviour}, introducing \textbf{Hebbian learning} (``neurons that fire together, wire together'') and first proposed learning rules for neural adaptation.

    \item   \textbf{1958:} Frank Rosenblatt introduced the \textbf{perceptron}, the first trainable neural network models using a binary classifier with adjustable rates.
            It could learn from examples using an error-correction rule.
            \[
                y = f \left( \sum^n_{i=1} w_ix_i + b \right) \quad \text{where } f(z) =
                \begin{cases}
                    1 & \text{if } z \geq 0 \\
                    0 & \text{otherwise}
                \end{cases}
            \]

    \item   \textbf{1969:} Minsky \& Papert published \textit{Perceptrons}, proving the fundamental limitations of single-layer perceptrons and demonstrated that they could not learn simple functions like \verb|XOR|;
            the famous \verb|XOR| problem became emblematic of perceptron limitations.
            The impact of this was a shift of focus to symbolic AI approaches.
            There was a need for multiple layers to solve non-linearly separable problems, and there was a lack of effective training methods for multi-layer networks.
    
    \item   \textbf{1986:} Rumelhart, Hinton, \& Williams popularised \textbf{backpropagation}, an efficient algorithm for training multi-layer networks based on the chain rule for computing gradients, thus solving the \verb|XOR| problem and more complex pattern-recognition tasks.
            Challenges that limited the adoption of artificial neural networks at this time included:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item   Computational limitations (training was extremely slow);
                \item   Vanishing / exploding gradient problems in deep networks;
                \item   Other approaches outperformed neural networks on many tasks;
                \item   Need for large labelled datasets.
            \end{itemize}

        \item   \textbf{2006:} Hinton et al. introduced \textbf{deep belief networks}, allowing for effective training of deep architectures.

        \item   \textbf{2010:} GPU computing transformed neural network training, making it orders of magnitude faster for matrix operations and enabling training of much larger networks.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Neuro-Evolution}
\textbf{Neuro-evolution} is the application of evolutionary algorithms to optimise neural networks.
It is also adopted in the field of Artificial Life as a means to explore different learning approaches.
The main approaches include direct encoding (weights, topologies) \& indirect encoding.
Neuro-evolution can achieve global optimisation as they are less prone to local optima, can optimise both architectures \& hyperparameters.
It is a useful approach when the architecture is unknown and is useful on highly multi-modal landscapes.
\\\\
In Artificial Life, neural networks are viewed as ``brains'': controllers for artificial organisms that enable complex behaviours \& adaptation.
The biological inspiration is from the evolution of nervous systems and environmental pressures driving cognitive complexity.
The goal is to understand how intelligence emerges through evolutionary processes.
\\\\
\textbf{Open-ended evolution} is defined by continuous adaptation \& complexity growth.
Challenges associated with open-ended evolution in Artificial Life include creating sufficient environmental complexity, maintaining selective pressure over time, \& avoiding evolutionary dead-ends.
Increasing network complexity for neural networks in open-ended evolution correlates with behavioural complexity, and incremental evolution builds on previous capabilities.
The current research frontier is creating truly open-ended neural evolution.
\\\\
\textbf{Simple neuro-evolution} has a fixed network topology with a pre-determined architecture (e.g., layers, connectivity) and only weights are evolved.
The encoding strategy is direct, with each weight being a separate gene.
The genetic operators used are mutation (applying random perturbations to weights) \& crossover (combining weights from parents).
The advantage of this approach is that it is simple \& efficient, but it is limited by architecture constraints.
The neuro-evolution process is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item   \textbf{Initialisation:} generate an initial population of neural networks.
    \item   \textbf{Evaluation:} assess the fitness of each network on a task.
    \item   \textbf{Selection:} choose networks to reproduce based on their fitness.
    \item   \textbf{Reproduction:} create new networks through crossover \& mutation.
    \item   \textbf{Repeat:} iterate through generations until convergence.
\end{enumerate}

Potential representations for neuro-evolution include direct coding, marker-based encoding, \& indirect coding

\subsubsection{NEAT}
\textbf{NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT)} is concerned with the simultaneous evolution of weights \textit{and} topology that starts with a minimal network and grows the complexity as needed.
It uses speciation to protection innovations.
Its genetic operators include  weight mutation, add connection, add node, \& crossover with history tracking.
The advantages of NEAT is that it facilitates the exploration of large search spaces, adapts to dynamic environments, and is effective for complex problem domains.
It has applications in evolutionary robotics \& game-playing agents.

\subsubsection{Artificial Life Models}
In addition to application to practical optimisation problems, the neuro-evolution model has been adopted in a range of artificial life models where one can explore the interplay between population-based learning (genetic algorithms), lifetime learning (NNs), \& other forms of learning, and has led to some interesting results.
Key areas in which Artificial Life models are used include signalling, language evolution, movement behaviours, flocking/clustering, \& means to explore the interplay between different learning types.
Types of learning in Artificial Life include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   Population-based learning (modelled with GAs);
    \item   Lifetime learning (modelled with NNs);
    \item   Cultural learning (allows communication between agents).
\end{itemize}

Consider a population of agents represented by NNs subject to evolutionary pressures (GAs).
Many theories have been proposed to explain the evolution of traits in populations (Darwinian, Lamarckian, etc.).
The \textbf{Baldwin effect} is a concept in evolutionary biology that suggests that learned behaviours acquired by individuals during their lifetime can influence the direction of evolution.
Learned behaviours initially arise through individual learning and are not genetically encoded.
Over time, individuals with adaptive learned behaviours may have higher fitness, leading to differential reproduction.
Selection pressure favours those individuals with certain learned behaviours. 
Eventually, these once-learned behaviours may become innate or genetically predisposed in subsequent generations.
Hinton \& Nowlan experiments show this effect.
\\\\
Combining lifetime \& evolutionary learning can evolve greater plasticity in populations and can evolve the ability to learn useful functions.
This can be useful in changing environment, as it allows populations to adapt.
\textbf{Cultural learning} allows agents to learn from each other, and has been shown to allow even greater plasticity in populations.
It has been used in conjunction with lifetime learning \& population-based learning and has been used to model the emergence of signals, ``language'', dialects, etc.

\subsection{Case Studies}
\subsubsection{Evolved Communication}
The problem of evolving multi-agent communication involves agents with neural signalling networks with no pre-defined communication protocols, that must evolve signals \& interpretations.
The key findings are that communication emerges when beneficial and signal complexity matches task complexity.
Applications involve the origin of language models, emergent semantics, \& multi-agent co-ordination.

\subsubsection{Predator-Prey Co-Evolution}
The experimental set-up for predator-prey evolution consists of populations of predator \& prey agents, neural controllers for sensing \& movement, and evolving in a shared environment.
The \textbf{Red Queen dynamics} are a continuous arms race with adaptation \& counter-adaptation, and no stable equilibrium.

\subsubsection{Evolving Deep Neural Networks}
Challenges include the high-dimensional search spaces, computational requirements, \& efficient encoding of complex architectures.

\section{Explainable AI}
Explainable AI is a large research are that has received much attention as of late in the machine learning community.
It has a long history in AI research and has much domain-specific work.
The ``black box'' nature of many AI systems leads to a lack of transparency, and makes it difficult to explain their decisions.
\textbf{Explainable AI (XAI)} promotes AI algorithms that can show their internal process and explain how they make their decisions.
Deep learning has out-performed traditional ML approaches but there is a lack of transparency.
\\\\
Many things rely on AI decisions, such as product recommendations, friend suggestions, new recommendations, autonomous vehicles, financial decisions, \& medical recommendations.
There are also regulations such as GDPR and the FDA on medical decisions/predictions, and the Algorithmic Accountability Act 2019, as well as many others.
Users need to understand \textit{why} AI makes specific recommendations;
if there is a lack of trust, then there will be lower adoption.
There is also ethical responsibility: accountability for algorithmic decisions and detecting \& mitigating bias.
\\\\
Explainability is also useful for debugging \& improvement, such as for understanding failures, model \& algorithm enhancement, detecting adversarial attacks, and informing feature engineering \& future data collection.

\subsection{Evaluation}
Evaluation of explanations can be made under three headings:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   \textbf{Correctness:} how accurately the explanation represents the model's actual decision process;
    \item   \textbf{Comprehensibility:} how understandable the explanation is to the target audience;
    \item   \textbf{Efficiency:} computational \& cognitive resources required to generate \& process explanations.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{User-centered methods} for evaluation of explanations typically look at:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   Simulated task experiments: \textit{do explanations improve user performance on specific tasks?};
    \item   Effect on trust: \textit{assessing if explanations appropriately increase or decrease user trust based on model capabilities}.
\end{itemize}

Humans generally prefer simple explanations, such as causal structures, etc., which makes capturing edge cases difficult.
\\\\
\textbf{Computational evaluation methods} include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   \textbf{Perturbation-based changes:} identify the top $k$ features, perturb the features (alter, delete, replace with random), and plot the prediction versus the number of features perturbed.
            Usually, the bigger the change following perturbation, the better the feature.

    \item   \textbf{Example-based explanation:} generation of an example to explain the prediction.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item   \textbf{Prototypes:} representative examples that illustrate typical cases;
                \item   \textbf{Counterfactuals:} examples showing how inputs could be minimally changed to get different outcomes;
                \item   \textbf{Influential instances:} training examples that have the most influence;
                \item   \textbf{Boundary examples:} cases near the decision boundary that demonstrate the model's limitations.
            \end{itemize}

            For example-based explanation, evaluation metrics include:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item   \textbf{Proximity:} how close examples are to the original input;
                \item   \textbf{Diversity:} variety of examples provided;
                \item   \textbf{Plausibility:} whether examples seem realistic to users.
            \end{itemize}

    \item   \textbf{Saliency} methods highlight the input features or regions that most influence a model's prediction.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item   \textbf{Gradient-based methods:} calculate the sensitivity of output with respect to input features;
                \item   \textbf{Perturbation-based methods:} observe prediction changes when features are modified.
            \end{itemize}

            Applications of saliency methods include:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item   Image classification: highlighting regions that influenced the classification;
                \item   NNLP: identifying influential words or phrases in text classification.
            \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{XAI Approaches}
In AI systems, we typically use data to give a recommendation, classification, prediction, etc.
In XAI, we give the recommendation \textit{and} an explanation, and typically try to allow feedback.

\textbf{Pre-modelling explainability} includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   Data selection;
    \item   Preparation transparency;
    \item   Feature engineering (\& documentation): why certain variables were selected;
    \item   Design constraints documentation: outlining constraints \& considerations.
    \item   Success metrics definition: how the algorithm's performance will be measured beyond just technical accuracy.
\end{itemize}

An \textbf{explanation} is the meaning behind a decision;
a decision may be correct, but complex (such as a conjunction of many features).
Giving an explanation for non-linear models is more difficult.
Often, as accuracy increases, explainability suffers:
linear models are relatively easy to explain, while NN \& non-linear models are harder to explain. 
There is usually a trade-off between performance \& explainability;
much previous work has concentrated on improving performance and has largely ignored transparency.
XAI attempts to enable better model interpretability while maintaining performance.
\\\\
Some models are \textbf{intrinsically explainable:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item   In linear regression, the effect of each feature is the weight of the feature times the feature value.
    \item   Decision tree-based models split the data multiple times according to certain cutoff values in the features.
            The decision path can be decomposed into one component per feature, with all edges connected by an \verb|AND|;
            we can then measure the importance of the feature by considering the information gain.
\end{itemize}

Similarly, in reasoning systems, explanations can be generated relatively easily.
Oftentimes, simple explanation concepts can be helpful;
consider a complex MAS with learning: it can be hard to explain dynamics, but analysis of equilibria can give a reasonable explanation of likely outcomes.
\\\\
Basic learning approaches may give better understanding / explanations;
if some function is learnable from a simple model, then use the simple model, as this tends to lead to better explainability.
As we move to more complex models which are less interpretable, other approaches are adopted such as
feature importance, dependence plots, \& sensitivity analysis.

\subsubsection{Explainability in Neural Networks}
It can be difficult to generate explanations for neural networks.
Neural networks can also be extremely sensitive to perturbations and are susceptible to adversarial attacks.
The predictions for NNs must be aligned with humans to make sense to humans.
Approaches for this include simplifying the neural network, visualisation, \& highlight aspects.
