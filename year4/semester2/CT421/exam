    schemata theorem
    - GAs
    - representation / ooperataors

    questions relating to
    - diversity
    - novelty

    understanding balance betweeen
    - exploration
    - exploitation

    agents / artificial life
    - autonomous
    - emergence

    theory:
        - auctions
        - negotiation
        - speech act theory
        - game theory

    cellular automata / ant colony optimisation
        - neuro-evolution

    how to generate explanations

exam:
- 4 questoins do 3
- question 1: search
    - a) 2-player search
    - b) general search
    - c) modern where no full access to search spaces

- question 2: assignment 1
    - a) evolutionary computation
    - b) problem (some kind of optimisation of an NP hard problem, try to come up with representation to solve it)
    - relatively straightforward if you did assignment 1
    - come up with a fitness function or representation that is justifiable

- question 3:
    - a) game theory | some loose overlap with assignmnet 2
    - b) 
    - c) agent theory / agent systems
        - autonomy, negotiations, speech act theory

- question 4:
    - a) artificial life type stuff
    - b) general AI more general theory or models of ai
    - c) learning mechanisms / explainable ai

- bullet points are enough
- long essays take longer to pull out the points
- no mad surprises
