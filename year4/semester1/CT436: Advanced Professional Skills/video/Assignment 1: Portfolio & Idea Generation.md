# Idea Generation
Team Name: Settled

## The problem we want to solve
Property management is challenging, and landlords and tenants need better communication. There is a lack of transparency, trust, and streamlined processes in the rental market, leading to inefficiencies and frustrations for both parties.
It is difficult to find rental housing, with listing fragmented across various different platforms.
It is difficult for landlords to vet potential tenants and even more difficult for tenants to vet potential landlords.
With housing in Ireland now being more difficult to come by than ever, there is an increasing number of rental scams that prey off of people's desperation to find accommodation, particularly targeting people trying to immigrate to Ireland.
While the current tight regulations on rental properties can help to protect tenants, the complex natures of these laws makes it hard to tell when they are being broken, both for landlords who may accidentally be violation of these laws and for tenants who may be subject to a landlord who is deliberately breaking these laws.
This exact issue happened to one of our team members a year or two ago:
his landlord had maliciously increased rent beyond what was legal in the rent pressure zone in which the house was located, and was attempting to illegally increase the rent further by threatening an unlawful eviction.
As neither our team member nor his housemates were well-versed in rental law, it was exceedingly difficult for them to identify that what was happening was illegal and for them to take steps to seek legal protection and redress.

### Criteria used to judge a potential solution
Any potential solution generated by our idea generation techniques will have to fulfill the following criteria to be considered a viable solution:
 - Full life-cycle management of property rentals and management, from advertising the property, to lease-signing, to day-to-day maintenance, to returning the deposit at the end of the lease.
 - Rapid and consistent communication between landlords and tenants.
 - Protection for both parties from bad landlords or tenants through increased transparency.
 - Provision of information on landlord/tenant regulations.
 - Easy for landlords to follow legal regulations and comply with rental laws.

## Products / processes that we want to improve on
### Existing Products
- **DAFT.ie**  
  - Just listings.
  - Verification issues with users and properties.
  
The goal is to create a solution that covers the entire life cycle of property management and rental, with a focus on transparency, streamlined communication, and ease of use.

## Idea generation technique
**SCAMPER METHOD - DAFT**

- **Substitute:**  
  Replace external communication (emails) with internal messaging through an in-app chat feature.  
  Substitute Daft's "Email" button with a "Message" button, allowing landlords and tenants to communicate directly within the app.

- **Combine:**  
  Combine property listings with full management tools, including rent payment, maintenance requests, and document handling.

## Evaluating candidate ideas using the criteria specified
After considering the criteria, the best candidate idea is a full-featured property management app that handles everything from initial listing and tenant application to lease management, rent collection, maintenance requests, and renewal or end-of-tenancy processes.
